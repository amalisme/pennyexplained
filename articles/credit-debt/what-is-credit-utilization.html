                <p class="intro">Credit utilization is the percentage of your available credit that you're currently using. It's one of the most important factors in your credit score, accounting for about 30% of how your score is calculated.</p>

                <h2>How to Calculate It</h2>
                
                <p>The formula is simple: divide what you owe by your total credit limit, then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.</p>

                <p>If you have a credit card with a $1,000 limit and you're carrying a $300 balance, your utilization is 30%. That's $300 ÷ $1,000 = 0.30, or 30%.</p>

                <p>With multiple cards, you calculate both per-card and overall utilization. Let's say you have two cards. Card A has a $2,000 limit with a $400 balance. Card B has a $3,000 limit with a $600 balance.</p>

                <p>Card A utilization: $400 ÷ $2,000 = 20%</p>
                <p>Card B utilization: $600 ÷ $3,000 = 20%</p>
                <p>Overall utilization: $1,000 total balance ÷ $5,000 total credit = 20%</p>

                <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

                <p>Credit scoring models use utilization as a measure of financial stress. High utilization suggests you might be relying too heavily on credit, which makes you look like a higher risk to lenders.</p>

                <p>Lower utilization generally means a higher credit score. Someone using 10% of their available credit will typically have a better score than someone using 80%, assuming all other factors are equal.</p>

                <h2>The 30% Guideline</h2>

                <p>Many financial experts suggest keeping your utilization below 30%. This isn't a hard rule built into scoring formulas, but rather a general guideline based on how scores tend to respond.</p>

                <p>Using the earlier example, if you have $5,000 in total credit limits, staying below $1,500 in total balances keeps you under 30% utilization.</p>

                <p>Lower is generally better. People with the highest credit scores often have utilization under 10%. But going from 50% to 30% utilization will help your score more than going from 10% to 5%.</p>

                <h2>Per-Card vs Overall Utilization</h2>

                <p>Credit scoring looks at both your overall utilization and your per-card utilization. Maxing out one card while keeping others empty can still hurt your score.</p>

                <p>Let's say you have three cards with $2,000 limits each ($6,000 total). If you max out one card ($2,000 balance) and keep the others at zero, your overall utilization is 33%. But that one card shows 100% utilization, which negatively impacts your score.</p>

                <p>It's better to spread balances across cards than to max out individual cards. With the same $2,000 total balance spread as $667 across each of the three cards, you'd still have 33% overall utilization, but each card would only show 33% instead of one showing 100%.</p>

                <h2>When Utilization Gets Reported</h2>

                <p>Credit card companies typically report your balance to credit bureaus once a month, usually around your statement closing date. This is the date your monthly statement generates, not your payment due date.</p>

                <p>The balance reported might not be what you actually owe on the due date. If your statement closes on the 15th showing a $500 balance, that $500 gets reported even if you pay it down to $0 before the due date on the 30th.</p>

                <p>This means timing matters. If you want to lower your reported utilization, pay down your balance before your statement closing date.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example</h2>

                <p>Marcus has a credit card with a $4,000 limit. His statement closes on the 5th of each month, and payment is due on the 30th. Let's look at two scenarios:</p>

                <p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Marcus uses his card throughout the month and has a $2,800 balance when the statement closes on the 5th. He pays it off in full on the 25th. His reported utilization is 70% ($2,800 ÷ $4,000) even though he paid it off. This high utilization hurts his credit score.</p>

                <p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Marcus makes a payment of $2,400 on the 3rd, bringing his balance to $400 when the statement closes on the 5th. His reported utilization is 10% ($400 ÷ $4,000). He pays the remaining $400 on the 25th. This low utilization helps his credit score.</p>

                <p>In both scenarios, Marcus paid his bill in full and didn't pay any interest. But Scenario 2 results in a better credit score because of the lower reported utilization.</p>

                <h2>Zero Utilization</h2>

                <p>Having 0% utilization isn't always ideal. While it's much better than high utilization, some credit scoring models slightly prefer to see some activity.</p>

                <p>Having small balances like 1-5% utilization can be marginally better than 0%. But the difference is tiny. Don't worry about carrying a balance just to show utilization—the interest you'd pay isn't worth the potential small score boost.</p>

                <h2>Improving Your Utilization</h2>

                <p>You can lower your utilization in several ways. The most obvious is paying down your balances. If you owe $1,500 on a $3,000 limit card (50% utilization) and pay it down to $600, you drop to 20% utilization.</p>

                <p>Another way is requesting a credit limit increase. If your card issuer raises your limit from $3,000 to $5,000 while you still owe $1,500, your utilization drops from 50% to 30% without paying anything down.</p>

                <p>You can also make multiple payments throughout the month to keep balances lower. Instead of one payment before the due date, make smaller payments weekly to keep the reported balance lower.</p>

                <h2>Utilization Changes Quickly</h2>

                <p>Unlike payment history, which builds over years, utilization can change your score quickly. If you have high utilization one month and pay it down the next month, your score can improve within 30-60 days when the new lower balance gets reported.</p>

                <p>This makes utilization one of the fastest ways to improve your credit score if you have the money to pay down balances.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
