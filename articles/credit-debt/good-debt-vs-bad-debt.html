                <p class="intro">The idea of "good debt" versus "bad debt" is a way to think about borrowing money. Generally, good debt helps build wealth or increase income over time, while bad debt pays for things that lose value or don't provide long-term benefits.</p>

                <p>This isn't a hard rule. The same type of debt can be good or bad depending on your situation, the interest rate, and how you use what you borrow. But understanding these concepts helps you think more carefully about when borrowing makes sense.</p>

                <h2>What Makes Debt "Good"</h2>
                
                <p>Good debt typically has a few characteristics. It usually has a relatively low interest rate compared to other debts. It's used for something that increases in value or helps you earn more money over time. And it's manageable within your budget.</p>

                <p>The key question is: will this debt help improve your financial situation in the long run? If yes, it might be considered good debt.</p>

                <h2>Examples of Potentially Good Debt</h2>

                <h3>Mortgages</h3>
                <p>A mortgage to buy a home is often considered good debt. Homes typically increase in value over decades. A mortgage also replaces rent, which you'd pay anyway.</p>

                <p>If you take out a $250,000 mortgage at 6.5% interest, you'll pay a lot in interest over 30 years. But if the home increases in value from $250,000 to $400,000 over that time, you've built $150,000 in equity (not counting your payments toward principal).</p>

                <p>Plus, you're living somewhere while building ownership. Compare this to paying $1,500 in rent for 30 years, which totals $540,000 with nothing to show for it at the end.</p>

                <h3>Student Loans</h3>
                <p>Education debt can be good debt when it leads to higher earning potential. If you borrow $30,000 to get a degree that helps you earn $20,000 more per year, that debt might pay for itself within a few years.</p>

                <p>Someone with a bachelor's degree earns about $1 million more over their lifetime compared to someone with only a high school diploma, on average. If it costs $40,000 in student loans to get that degree, the long-term return is significant.</p>

                <p>However, borrowing $100,000 for a degree in a field with limited job opportunities and low pay might not offer the same return. Context matters a lot with student loans.</p>

                <h3>Business Loans</h3>
                <p>Taking on debt to start or grow a business can be good debt if the business generates income. If you borrow $50,000 to buy equipment that lets you earn an extra $30,000 per year, the debt pays for itself in under two years.</p>

                <p>But business debt is risky. Not all businesses succeed, so this can quickly become bad debt if the business fails.</p>

                <h2>What Makes Debt "Bad"</h2>

                <p>Bad debt typically has high interest rates. It's used for things that lose value immediately or don't provide lasting benefit. It's often taken on impulsively or for consumption rather than investment.</p>

                <p>Bad debt makes you poorer over time rather than wealthier. It doesn't build your future earning power or net worth.</p>

                <h2>Examples of Potentially Bad Debt</h2>

                <h3>High-Interest Credit Card Debt</h3>
                <p>Carrying a credit card balance at 20% interest to pay for everyday expenses or non-essential purchases is typically considered bad debt. You're paying a premium for things that don't increase in value.</p>

                <p>If you charge $2,000 for a vacation on a credit card at 18% interest and only make minimum payments, you might pay $800 in interest over the years it takes to pay off. That $2,000 vacation actually cost you $2,800.</p>

                <p>The memories might be valuable, but financially, you're paying extra for something that provided temporary enjoyment.</p>

                <h3>Payday Loans</h3>
                <p>Payday loans typically have extremely high interest rates, sometimes equivalent to 400% annual interest or more. A $500 payday loan might cost you $75 in fees for just two weeks, which works out to astronomical annual rates.</p>

                <p>These loans are almost always considered bad debt because of the crushing interest costs. People often get trapped in cycles of taking new payday loans to pay off old ones.</p>

                <h3>Auto Loans for Expensive Cars</h3>
                <p>Taking on a large auto loan for a car beyond your needs is generally bad debt. Cars lose value quickly. A new $40,000 car might be worth $30,000 after just one year.</p>

                <p>If you borrow $35,000 at 7% for 6 years to buy that car, you'll pay about $41,500 total. Meanwhile, the car is depreciating. Within a few years, you might owe more on the loan than the car is worth.</p>

                <h3>Debt for Consumables</h3>
                <p>Using credit cards or loans to buy things that get used up—like groceries, restaurants, or clothing—when you can't afford to pay the balance quickly is typically bad debt. These purchases don't create future value but come with interest costs.</p>

                <h2>The Gray Areas</h2>

                <p>Many types of debt fall somewhere in between clearly good and clearly bad. The classification depends on the specific situation.</p>

                <h3>Car Loans (Necessary Transportation)</h3>
                <p>A reasonable car loan for reliable transportation to get to work might be necessary and valuable. It enables you to earn income. A $15,000 loan at 5% for a dependable used car that gets you to a job paying $40,000 per year could be considered acceptable debt.</p>

                <p>But a $50,000 loan for a luxury vehicle you don't need would typically be bad debt, even though both are car loans.</p>

                <h3>Home Equity Loans</h3>
                <p>Borrowing against your home's equity can be good or bad. Using it to make home improvements that increase property value might be good. Using it to pay for a vacation or shopping spree is bad debt.</p>

                <h3>Medical Debt</h3>
                <p>Medical debt is often unavoidable rather than good or bad. You need healthcare, but the debt doesn't build wealth. It's necessary but doesn't fit neatly into either category.</p>

                <h2>Interest Rates Matter</h2>

                <p>The interest rate significantly affects whether debt is manageable or problematic. A mortgage at 6.5% interest has very different implications than credit card debt at 22% interest.</p>

                <p>Consider two people who each borrow $20,000:</p>

                <p><strong>Person A:</strong> Takes a home equity loan at 5% interest to renovate their kitchen. Monthly payment of $377 for 5 years. Total interest paid: $2,640.</p>

                <p><strong>Person B:</strong> Charges $20,000 to credit cards at an average of 20% interest. Makes minimum payments of $400/month. Takes about 9 years to pay off. Total interest paid: about $23,000.</p>

                <p>Person B pays nearly 10 times more in interest for the same amount borrowed. High interest rates turn manageable debt into a major burden.</p>

                <h2>Context Is Everything</h2>

                <p>Your income, job security, and overall financial situation matter when evaluating debt. Someone earning $150,000 per year with no other debts can handle debt differently than someone earning $35,000 with multiple obligations.</p>

                <p>A $30,000 student loan might be good debt for one person and crushing debt for another, depending on what degree they got and what income it leads to.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example</h2>

                <p>Maria is considering two purchases:</p>

                <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Take out a $25,000 student loan at 5% interest to finish her nursing degree. Nurses in her area start at $60,000 per year. Her current job pays $32,000. The loan payment would be $265/month for 10 years. After graduation, she'd earn an extra $28,000 per year (before taxes), easily covering the loan payment.</p>

                <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Use a credit card with 19% interest to buy a $5,000 home entertainment system. If she makes minimum payments of $125/month, it would take about 5.5 years to pay off and cost about $3,100 in interest. The system will be outdated long before it's paid off.</p>

                <p>Option 1 resembles good debt—it increases her earning power and has a manageable interest rate. Option 2 resembles bad debt—high interest for something that depreciates and doesn't improve her financial situation.</p>
