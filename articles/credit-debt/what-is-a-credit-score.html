                <p class="intro">A credit score is a three-digit number between 300 and 850 that represents how trustworthy you are with borrowed money. It's like a financial report card that lenders use to decide if they'll lend to you.</p>

                <p>Think of your credit score like a grade in school. Just as a high GPA shows you're a good student, a high credit score shows you're good at managing credit and paying bills on time.</p>

                <h2>The Credit Score Scale</h2>
                
                <p>Credit scores in the US typically range from 300 to 850. The higher your score, the better. Here's how the ranges generally break down:</p>

                <p><strong>Excellent (750-850):</strong> You're in great shape. Lenders see you as very low risk. You'll get approved for most credit applications and receive the best interest rates.</p>

                <p><strong>Good (700-749):</strong> You're doing well. Most lenders will approve your applications, and you'll get competitive interest rates. This is where many people aim to be.</p>

                <p><strong>Fair (650-699):</strong> You're okay, but there's room to improve. You can still get approved for credit, but you might not get the best rates. Some lenders might require additional steps.</p>

                <p><strong>Poor (600-649):</strong> You might face challenges. Approval is harder to get, and interest rates will be higher. You'll pay more over time for the same loans.</p>

                <p><strong>Very Poor (300-599):</strong> Getting approved for credit is difficult. If you do get approved, expect very high interest rates and strict terms.</p>

                <h2>What Your Score Affects</h2>

                <h3>Interest Rates</h3>
                <p>Your credit score directly impacts how much you pay to borrow money. Someone with a 760 credit score might get a car loan at 4% interest. Someone with a 620 score might pay 10% interest on the same loan.</p>

                <p>On a $25,000 car loan over 5 years, that difference in interest rates means paying about $1,300 vs $3,350 in interest. The person with the lower score pays over $2,000 more for the same car.</p>

                <h3>Credit Card Approvals</h3>
                <p>Credit card companies check your score when you apply. A higher score gives you access to cards with better rewards, lower fees, and higher credit limits. A lower score might mean getting denied or only qualifying for cards with high fees.</p>

                <h3>Apartment Rentals</h3>
                <p>Most landlords check credit scores before approving rental applications. They want to know if you pay your bills on time. A low score might mean getting rejected or needing a larger security deposit.</p>

                <h3>Other Areas</h3>
                <p>Some employers check credit scores during the hiring process, especially for jobs handling money. Phone companies and utility providers might require deposits if your score is low. Insurance companies in some states use credit scores to set rates.</p>

                <h2>Multiple Credit Scores</h2>

                <p>You don't have just one credit score. You actually have several. Different companies calculate scores slightly differently.</p>

                <p>The two main scoring models are FICO and VantageScore. Most lenders use FICO scores, which come in different versions. Your auto lender might use FICO Auto Score 8, while your mortgage lender uses FICO Score 2.</p>

                <p>Don't worry if you see your score listed as different numbers in different places. Small variations are normal. What matters is the general range you're in.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example</h2>

                <p>Maria wants to buy a house. She has a credit score of 720. The bank offers her a 30-year mortgage for $300,000 at 6.5% interest. Her monthly payment would be about $1,896.</p>

                <p>Her friend John has a score of 640. He gets approved for the same size loan, but at 8% interest. His monthly payment is $2,201. Over 30 years, John will pay about $110,000 more than Maria for the same house, just because of their credit score difference.</p>

                <h2>Checking Your Score</h2>

                <p>Many credit card companies now offer free credit score access to their customers. You can also check your score through various free websites and apps. These scores give you a good idea of where you stand.</p>

                <p>Your actual score used by a lender might be slightly different, but free scores help you track your progress and spot any major issues.</p>

                <h2>Important Things to Know</h2>

                <p>Your credit score changes over time based on how you use credit. It's not permanent. You can improve a low score by making better financial choices, though it takes time.</p>

                <p>Checking your own credit score doesn't hurt it. Only when lenders check your score for a credit application (called a "hard inquiry") can it potentially lower your score slightly.</p>

                <p>Building a good credit score takes time. There's no quick fix or instant way to boost your score significantly. It's about consistent responsible behavior over months and years.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
