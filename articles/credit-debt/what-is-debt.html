                <p class="intro">Debt is money you owe to someone else. When you borrow money and agree to pay it back later, you're taking on debt. The person or company you owe is called a creditor or lender.</p>

                <p>Think of debt as a promise. You receive something now (money, a car, a house) and promise to pay for it later, usually with interest added on top of what you borrowed.</p>

                <h2>How Debt Works</h2>
                
                <p>When you take on debt, you're entering into an agreement. You agree to pay back what you borrowed, usually in regular payments over a set period of time. Most debt also includes interest, which is the cost of borrowing the money.</p>

                <p>If you borrow $5,000 to buy a car and agree to pay it back over 3 years at 7% interest, you'd make monthly payments of about $154. Over those 3 years, you'd pay back the $5,000 plus about $545 in interest, totaling $5,545.</p>

                <h2>Common Types of Debt</h2>

                <h3>Credit Card Debt</h3>
                <p>This is debt you carry on credit cards when you don't pay the full balance each month. It's called "revolving debt" because the amount can go up and down as you make charges and payments.</p>

                <p>If you charge $800 to your credit card and only pay $100 when the bill comes, you now have $700 in credit card debt. Interest gets added to this balance each month until you pay it off.</p>

                <h3>Student Loans</h3>
                <p>Money borrowed to pay for education. These loans typically have lower interest rates than other types of debt. You usually start repaying after you finish school.</p>

                <p>Someone who borrows $30,000 for college at 5% interest might pay about $318 per month for 10 years, paying back about $38,160 total.</p>

                <h3>Auto Loans</h3>
                <p>Loans taken out to buy a vehicle. The car itself serves as collateral, meaning if you stop making payments, the lender can take the car back.</p>

                <p>A $25,000 car loan at 6% interest for 5 years would have monthly payments of about $483. You'd pay about $29,000 total over the 5 years.</p>

                <h3>Mortgages</h3>
                <p>Loans used to buy homes or property. These are typically the largest debts people take on. They're paid back over long periods, often 15 or 30 years.</p>

                <p>A $300,000 mortgage at 6.5% interest for 30 years would have monthly payments of about $1,896. Over 30 years, you'd pay about $682,500 total—more than double the amount borrowed.</p>

                <h3>Personal Loans</h3>
                <p>Loans that can be used for various purposes like consolidating other debts, medical expenses, or home improvements. They typically have fixed payments over a set term.</p>

                <p>A $10,000 personal loan at 10% interest for 3 years would cost about $323 per month, with total repayment of about $11,616.</p>

                <h2>Secured vs Unsecured Debt</h2>

                <h3>Secured Debt</h3>
                <p>Debt backed by collateral—something valuable the lender can take if you don't pay. Mortgages and car loans are secured. The house or car serves as collateral.</p>

                <p>Because the lender has less risk (they can take the collateral if you don't pay), secured debt usually has lower interest rates. A car loan might be 5-8% while an unsecured loan might be 10-15%.</p>

                <h3>Unsecured Debt</h3>
                <p>Debt not backed by any specific asset. Credit cards and most personal loans are unsecured. If you don't pay, the lender can't automatically take your possessions, though they can hurt your credit and take other legal actions.</p>

                <p>Because unsecured debt is riskier for lenders, it comes with higher interest rates. Credit card rates often range from 16% to 25% or higher.</p>

                <h2>How Debt Affects Your Life</h2>

                <h3>Monthly Payments</h3>
                <p>Debt creates ongoing payment obligations. These payments come out of your monthly income before you can use that money for other things.</p>

                <p>Someone earning $3,500 per month with $800 in student loans, $400 in car payments, and $200 in credit card minimums has $1,400 in debt payments. That leaves only $2,100 for rent, food, savings, and everything else.</p>

                <h3>Credit Score Impact</h3>
                <p>How you handle debt affects your credit score. Making payments on time helps your score. Missing payments or carrying high balances hurts it. Your credit score then affects your ability to borrow in the future and what interest rates you'll get.</p>

                <h3>Interest Costs</h3>
                <p>Debt means paying more than the original price. That $25,000 car actually costs you $29,000 because of interest. High-interest debt like credit cards can cost much more over time.</p>

                <h3>Financial Flexibility</h3>
                <p>Debt reduces your options. Money going to debt payments can't be used for emergencies, opportunities, or other goals. High debt loads can make it harder to qualify for new loans or rent an apartment.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example</h2>

                <p>Tyler graduates college with $35,000 in student loans at 5% interest. He also has $3,000 in credit card debt at 19% interest from books and living expenses. He gets a job paying $45,000 per year.</p>

                <p>His student loan payment is $371 per month for 10 years. If he only pays the $75 minimum on his credit card, it would take over 4 years to pay off and cost him about $1,400 in interest.</p>

                <p>Between the two debts, he's paying about $450 per month before other expenses. His take-home pay (after taxes) is about $3,000 per month, so debt payments take up 15% of his income.</p>

                <h2>Paying Down Debt</h2>

                <p>Debt gets paid down through regular payments. Each payment typically covers some interest and some of the original amount borrowed (called the principal).</p>

                <p>Early in a loan, more of your payment goes to interest. Later, more goes to principal. This is why paying extra on debt, especially early on, can save a lot of money in interest.</p>

                <p>If Tyler pays an extra $100 per month on his student loans, he'd pay them off in about 7.5 years instead of 10 and save about $3,000 in interest.</p>

                <h2>Debt vs Having Money</h2>

                <p>Debt is the opposite of having money. If you have $1,000 in savings and $1,000 in credit card debt, you essentially have $0 in net worth from those two things.</p>

                <p>Actually, you're worse off than zero because the debt is charging you interest (maybe 18% or $180 per year) while savings might only earn 2% or $20 per year. The debt costs you $160 more per year than the savings earns.</p>

                <h2>When Debt Becomes a Problem</h2>

                <p>Debt becomes problematic when payments become hard to manage. Warning signs include making only minimum payments, using new credit cards to pay old ones, missing payment due dates, or having debt payments that consume more than 40% of your income.</p>

                <p>Some people can manage $50,000 in debt comfortably because they have high income and low other expenses. Others struggle with $5,000 in debt because their income is lower or their other expenses are high. It's about the relationship between your debt, income, and expenses.</p>
