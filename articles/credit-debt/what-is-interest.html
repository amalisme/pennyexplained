                <p class="intro">Interest is money paid for borrowing money, or money earned for lending or saving money. It's the cost of using someone else's money, or the reward for letting someone else use yours.</p>

                <h2>Interest When You Borrow</h2>
                
                <p>When you borrow money, you pay interest to the lender. Think of it as a rental fee for using their money. The longer you borrow and the riskier you seem as a borrower, the more interest you typically pay.</p>

                <p>If you borrow $1,000 from a credit card company at 20% annual interest and take a full year to pay it back, you'd pay about $200 in interest. You'd return $1,200 total—the $1,000 you borrowed plus $200 for the privilege of borrowing it.</p>

                <h2>Interest When You Save</h2>

                <p>When you put money in a savings account, the bank pays you interest. The bank uses your money to make loans to other people, and they share some of their profit with you as interest.</p>

                <p>If you put $1,000 in a savings account with 2% annual interest, after one year you'd have $1,020. The bank paid you $20 for letting them use your $1,000.</p>

                <h2>How Interest Rates Work</h2>

                <p>Interest rates are usually shown as an annual percentage. A 15% interest rate means you pay (or earn) 15% of the amount per year.</p>

                <p>But interest is often calculated monthly, not just yearly. A credit card with 18% annual interest actually charges about 1.5% per month (18% ÷ 12 months). If you carry a $100 balance for one month, you'd owe about $1.50 in interest for that month.</p>

                <h2>Simple vs Compound Interest</h2>

                <h3>Simple Interest</h3>
                <p>Simple interest is calculated only on the original amount. If you borrow $1,000 at 10% simple annual interest for 3 years, you pay $100 in interest each year, totaling $300 over 3 years.</p>

                <p>Year 1: $1,000 × 10% = $100 interest</p>
                <p>Year 2: $1,000 × 10% = $100 interest</p>
                <p>Year 3: $1,000 × 10% = $100 interest</p>
                <p>Total interest: $300</p>

                <h3>Compound Interest</h3>
                <p>Compound interest is calculated on the original amount plus any accumulated interest. This is more common with credit cards and savings accounts.</p>

                <p>With the same $1,000 at 10% annual interest compounding yearly for 3 years:</p>

                <p>Year 1: $1,000 × 10% = $100 interest (total: $1,100)</p>
                <p>Year 2: $1,100 × 10% = $110 interest (total: $1,210)</p>
                <p>Year 3: $1,210 × 10% = $121 interest (total: $1,331)</p>
                <p>Total interest: $331</p>

                <p>You pay more with compound interest because each period's interest is added to the balance, and then interest is charged on that new higher amount.</p>

                <h2>Credit Card Interest Example</h2>

                <p>Let's say you have a credit card with an 18% APR (Annual Percentage Rate). You charge $500 and only make the minimum payment each month.</p>

                <p>The credit card charges about 1.5% interest per month on your balance. In the first month, you'd be charged about $7.50 in interest ($500 × 1.5%). If your minimum payment is $25, about $7.50 goes to interest and only $17.50 actually reduces what you owe.</p>

                <p>Next month, you owe $482.50 ($500 - $17.50). The interest is now calculated on this new amount. This is why it takes so long to pay off credit cards making only minimum payments.</p>

                <h2>Loan Interest Example</h2>

                <p>Car loans and mortgages work differently. Let's say you take out a $20,000 car loan at 6% interest for 5 years.</p>

                <p>Your monthly payment would be about $387. In the first month, about $100 goes to interest ($20,000 × 6% ÷ 12 months) and $287 goes toward reducing your loan balance.</p>

                <p>As you pay down the loan, less goes to interest each month and more goes to principal. By the final payment, almost all of your $387 goes toward the loan balance because there's little left to charge interest on.</p>

                <p>Over the 5 years, you'd pay about $3,200 in total interest on top of the $20,000 you borrowed.</p>

                <h2>Factors That Affect Interest Rates</h2>

                <h3>Credit Score</h3>
                <p>People with higher credit scores get lower interest rates because they're seen as less risky. Someone with a 780 credit score might get a car loan at 4%, while someone with a 620 score might pay 10% for the same loan.</p>

                <h3>Loan Type</h3>
                <p>Different types of loans have different interest rates. Mortgages typically have lower rates (maybe 6-7%) because the house serves as collateral. Credit cards have higher rates (maybe 16-24%) because there's no collateral.</p>

                <h3>Loan Length</h3>
                <p>Longer loans often have higher interest rates. A 5-year car loan might be 5%, while a 7-year loan for the same car might be 6.5%. The longer time means more risk for the lender.</p>

                <h3>Economic Conditions</h3>
                <p>Interest rates change based on the broader economy. When the Federal Reserve raises rates, borrowing becomes more expensive across the board. When they lower rates, loans generally become cheaper.</p>

                <h2>Avoiding or Minimizing Interest</h2>

                <p>With credit cards, you can avoid interest entirely by paying your full statement balance before the due date. If your statement shows you owe $450 and you pay $450 before the due date, you pay zero interest.</p>

                <p>This is called the "grace period." Most credit cards give you about 21-25 days after your statement closes to pay without interest charges. But if you carry any balance past the due date, interest starts accruing.</p>

                <p>With loans, you typically can't avoid interest, but you can minimize it by making extra payments toward the principal or choosing a shorter loan term.</p>

                <h2>APR vs APY</h2>

                <p>APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is used for borrowing. It's the yearly interest rate you'll pay on a loan or credit card.</p>

                <p>APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is used for savings. It includes compound interest, so it shows what you'll actually earn in a year.</p>

                <p>A savings account with 2% interest compounded monthly has a 2% APR but about 2.02% APY. The difference is small but the APY is slightly higher because of compounding.</p>
