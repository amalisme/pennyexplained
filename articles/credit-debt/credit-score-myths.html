                <p class="intro">There are many misconceptions about credit scores. Some people believe things that sound logical but aren't actually true. Understanding what really affects your score helps you make better financial decisions.</p>

                <h2>Myth: You Need to Carry a Balance to Build Credit</h2>
                
                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> You don't need to carry a balance or pay interest to build credit. Using a credit card and paying the full balance before the due date each month builds credit just as effectively as carrying a balance—and saves you money on interest.</p>

                <p>Your credit report shows that you made on-time payments whether you paid in full or just the minimum. What matters is that you pay at least the minimum by the due date every month.</p>

                <p>If you have a $500 credit card bill and pay $500 before the due date, you pay zero interest and still get full credit for an on-time payment. If you only pay $50 and carry the $450 balance, you get the same credit score benefit but now owe interest on the $450.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Checking Your Credit Score Hurts It</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Checking your own credit score or pulling your own credit report doesn't affect your score at all. This is called a "soft inquiry" and has zero impact.</p>

                <p>What does hurt your score is when lenders check your credit as part of a credit application. This is called a "hard inquiry" and can lower your score by a few points. But you checking your own score is completely different and safe to do as often as you want.</p>

                <p>Many credit card companies and banks now offer free credit score access to their customers. Using these services won't hurt your score in any way.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Income Affects Your Credit Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Your income has no direct effect on your credit score. The scoring models don't even know how much money you make. Someone earning $30,000 per year can have the same credit score as someone earning $300,000.</p>

                <p>What matters is how you handle the credit you have, not how much money you earn. Two people could each have $5,000 in credit card debt. If both pay on time and keep their balances manageable relative to their limits, they'd have similar credit scores regardless of their incomes.</p>

                <p>Lenders will ask about your income when you apply for credit, but that's a separate consideration from your credit score. They use both your score and your income to make lending decisions.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Closing Credit Cards Improves Your Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Closing credit cards usually hurts your score rather than helps it. This happens in two ways.</p>

                <p>First, closing a card reduces your total available credit, which increases your credit utilization percentage. If you have $10,000 in total credit and owe $2,000 (20% utilization), closing a card with a $3,000 limit drops your total to $7,000. Now you're at about 29% utilization with the same debt.</p>

                <p>Second, closing old accounts can lower your average account age over time, though the closed account continues to age on your report for up to 10 years after closing.</p>

                <p>If you're not paying an annual fee and the card isn't tempting you to overspend, it's usually better to keep it open even if you rarely use it.</p>

                <h2>Myth: You Only Have One Credit Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> You actually have dozens of credit scores. Different scoring models (FICO, VantageScore) calculate scores differently. Even within FICO, there are different versions for different purposes—auto scores, mortgage scores, credit card scores.</p>

                <p>Your FICO Score 8 might be 720, while your FICO Auto Score 9 is 735 and your VantageScore 3.0 is 710. These variations are normal. What matters is the general range you're in, not the exact number.</p>

                <p>Plus, each of the three credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) might have slightly different information about you, leading to slightly different scores from each bureau.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Paying Off Collections Removes Them From Your Report</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Paying a collection account doesn't make it disappear from your credit report. The account will update to show "paid" instead of "unpaid," but it remains on your report for 7 years from when the debt first became delinquent.</p>

                <p>Paying it can help a bit—newer scoring models treat paid collections more favorably than unpaid ones. But the collection entry itself stays on your report for the full 7 years regardless of whether you pay it.</p>

                <p>If you have a $300 medical bill in collections from 2022 and pay it off in 2024, it will still show on your report until 2029, just marked as paid.</p>

                <h2>Myth: You Need to Use All Your Credit Cards</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> You don't need to use every credit card you own to maintain good credit. As long as the account stays open and in good standing, it helps your credit age and total available credit.</p>

                <p>Some cards may close automatically if you don't use them for a very long time (often 12+ months of zero activity). To prevent this, you can make a small purchase every few months. But you don't need regular activity on all cards to maintain good credit scores.</p>

                <p>If you have five credit cards, using just one or two regularly while the others sit unused is perfectly fine for your credit score.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Married Couples Share a Credit Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Each person has their own individual credit score, even after marriage. Getting married doesn't combine credit scores or credit reports.</p>

                <p>If one spouse has a 780 credit score and the other has a 620, they keep those individual scores. Joint accounts (like a mortgage or joint credit card) will report to both people's credit reports, but each person still maintains their own separate score.</p>

                <p>This means one person's bad credit doesn't automatically hurt their spouse's credit. However, if they apply for credit together (like a mortgage), lenders typically use the lower of the two scores.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Credit Counseling Hurts Your Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Simply working with a credit counselor doesn't affect your credit score. The counseling itself isn't reported to credit bureaus.</p>

                <p>However, if you enroll in a debt management plan through a counselor where they negotiate with creditors, some creditors may note this on your credit report. The impact is usually minor. What helps your score is making on-time payments through the plan and reducing your debt.</p>

                <p>Missing payments before entering a plan hurts your score. Consistently paying through the plan helps rebuild it.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Debit Card Use Builds Credit</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Using a debit card doesn't affect your credit score at all. Debit cards draw from your checking account and aren't a form of credit, so they're not reported to credit bureaus.</p>

                <p>You could use a debit card for every purchase for 10 years and it would have zero impact on building credit. Only credit accounts (credit cards, loans, etc.) affect your credit score.</p>

                <p>This is why some financial experts suggest getting a credit card and using it responsibly, rather than relying only on debit cards, if you want to build credit history.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Paying Rent Builds Credit</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Most of the time, paying rent doesn't help build credit because landlords don't typically report rent payments to credit bureaus. You could pay rent on time for 5 years and it wouldn't appear on your credit report.</p>

                <p>However, some services now allow you to pay rent through them and they'll report it to credit bureaus. If you don't use one of these services, your rent payments won't affect your score.</p>

                <p>Not paying rent and getting evicted can hurt your credit if the debt goes to collections, but simply paying rent on time usually doesn't help your score.</p>

                <h2>Myth: You Can Quickly Fix a Bad Credit Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> There's no quick fix for a genuinely low credit score caused by missed payments or high debt. Building or rebuilding credit takes time, typically measured in months or years, not days or weeks.</p>

                <p>If your score is 550 because of multiple late payments and maxed-out cards, you can't boost it to 750 in a month. You need consistent on-time payments, lower balances, and time for negative items to age and matter less.</p>

                <p>Some changes can happen relatively quickly—paying down high credit card balances can improve your score in 1-2 months. But recovering from serious negative marks like collections or missed payments takes much longer.</p>

                <h2>Myth: Age Doesn't Matter</h2>

                <p><strong>The Truth:</strong> While your personal age doesn't affect your score, the age of your credit accounts does. Length of credit history accounts for 15% of your FICO score.</p>

                <p>Someone who opened their first credit card at age 18 and is now 28 has 10 years of credit history. Someone who opened their first card at age 25 and is now 28 has only 3 years of history. The first person likely has a better score, all else being equal.</p>

                <p>This is why financial experts often suggest opening a credit card early (and using it responsibly) to start building credit history, even if you don't need it immediately.</p>
