                <p>Credit scores are often misunderstood, leading to myths that can hurt people's financial decisions. Some myths cause people to avoid checking their credit when they should. Others lead people to make expensive mistakes like closing credit cards or carrying unnecessary balances. Let's separate fact from fiction with the most common credit score myths and the real truth behind each one.</p>

                <p>Understanding how credit actually works saves you money, helps you build better credit faster, and prevents you from following bad advice that damages your score. These aren't small differences - some of these myths cost people thousands of dollars in unnecessary interest or prevent them from getting loans entirely.</p>

                <h2>Myth #1: Checking Your Credit Hurts Your Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> Looking at your own credit score or credit report damages it, so you should avoid checking your credit.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Checking your own credit is a "soft inquiry" (also called a "soft pull") and has absolutely zero impact on your score. You can check as often as you want - daily if you like - without any negative effect whatsoever.</p>

                <p><strong>What DOES hurt your score:</strong> When lenders check your credit as part of a credit application (called a "hard inquiry" or "hard pull"), this can temporarily drop your score by 5-10 points. But even these impacts are small and fade within months.</p>

                <p><strong>Why this myth is dangerous:</strong> People avoid checking their credit reports for years, missing errors, identity theft, or fraudulent accounts that could be tanking their score. Regular monitoring is actually essential for protecting your credit.</p>

                <p><strong>How to check safely:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AnnualCreditReport.com - free official reports from all three bureaus</li>
                    <li>Credit monitoring services from your bank or credit card</li>
                    <li>Free credit score apps (Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Your credit card's free score feature</li>
                </ul>

                <p>All of these are soft inquiries. Check as often as you want with zero score impact.</p>

                <h2>Myth #2: Closing Credit Cards Helps Your Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> Closing unused credit cards improves your score by reducing available credit and showing you're not relying on credit cards.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Closing credit cards usually hurts your score in two significant ways: it reduces your total available credit (increasing your utilization ratio) and potentially lowers your average account age.</p>

                <p><strong>Real example showing the damage:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Before closing:</strong> You have three cards with $5,000 limits each = $15,000 total available credit. You carry $3,000 in balances total. Utilization: $3,000 ÷ $15,000 = 20% (good)</li>
                    <li><strong>After closing one card:</strong> Now you have $10,000 total available credit. Same $3,000 in balances. Utilization: $3,000 ÷ $10,000 = 30% (worse)</li>
                    <li><strong>Score impact:</strong> Your score drops 15-30 points because <a href="what-is-credit-utilization.html">credit utilization</a> jumped from 20% to 30%</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>When closing cards MIGHT make sense:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Card has an annual fee you don't want to pay (ask to downgrade to no-fee version first)</li>
                    <li>You genuinely can't control spending with available credit</li>
                    <li>You're being charged inactivity fees</li>
                </ul>

                <p>But even in these cases, the credit score hit is real. Consider alternatives like downgrading the card or just not using it.</p>

                <h2>Myth #3: You Need to Carry a Balance to Build Credit</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> You must carry a balance and pay interest each month to improve your credit score. Paying in full means you're "not using credit."</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> This is completely false and costs people thousands in unnecessary interest. Paying your full balance every month builds credit just as well - actually better - than carrying a balance. Credit scores care that you USE credit responsibly and pay on time, not that you pay <a href="what-is-interest.html">interest</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>How it actually works:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You use your credit card during the month</li>
                    <li>Card issuer reports your balance to credit bureaus (usually on statement closing date)</li>
                    <li>Credit bureaus see you're using credit - ✓ Good for score</li>
                    <li>You pay full balance before due date</li>
                    <li>Next month shows $0 interest charged - you saved money!</li>
                    <li>Credit bureaus see on-time payment - ✓ Great for score</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>The expensive myth calculation:</strong> If you carry a $1,000 balance at 20% APR to "build credit," you pay $200 in interest annually for absolutely zero credit score benefit. Over 5 years, that's $1,000 wasted on a myth.</p>

                <p><strong>What you SHOULD do:</strong> Use your card regularly for normal purchases, let a small balance report on your statement (even $5-50), then pay the full statement balance before the due date. You build credit AND avoid interest. Best of both worlds.</p>

                <h2>Myth #4: Income Affects Your Credit Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> Making more money improves your credit score directly. Rich people automatically have better credit.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Your <a href="../finance-basics/what-is-income.html">income</a> is NOT part of credit score calculations at all - not even a little bit. FICO and VantageScore (the two main scoring models) don't factor in how much you earn.</p>

                <p><strong>Real-world examples proving this:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Someone earning $35,000/year who pays all bills on time, keeps utilization low, and has a long credit history: 780 score</li>
                    <li>Someone earning $250,000/year who misses payments, maxes out cards, and just opened credit recently: 620 score</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What credit scores actually measure:</strong> How you handle borrowed money, not how much money you make. Payment history, utilization, credit age, credit mix, and new credit - that's it. Income never enters the equation.</p>

                <p><strong>Why income matters differently:</strong> While income doesn't affect your score directly, lenders DO look at income when deciding whether to approve you and how much to lend. Higher income can help you get approved even with a moderate score, but it won't magically raise your credit score number.</p>

                <h2>Myth #5: Paying Off Collections Removes Them</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> Once you pay a collection account, it disappears from your credit report immediately, and your score bounces back.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Paid collections stay on your credit report for 7 years from the date of first delinquency (the date you first fell behind on the original debt). They're simply marked as "paid" instead of "unpaid."</p>

                <p><strong>Timeline example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>January 2020:</strong> You stop paying a credit card</li>
                    <li><strong>July 2020:</strong> Account goes to collections (6 months late)</li>
                    <li><strong>March 2024:</strong> You finally pay off the collection</li>
                    <li><strong>When it falls off:</strong> January 2027 (7 years from first delinquency, not from when you paid)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The good news:</strong> Newer scoring models (FICO 9, VantageScore 3.0 and 4.0) ignore paid collections entirely. However, many lenders still use older models that count paid collections, just slightly less negatively than unpaid ones.</p>

                <p><strong>Best strategy:</strong> Before paying, try "pay for delete" negotiations - agree to pay if they remove it from your credit report entirely. Get it in writing before paying. Not all collectors will agree, but it's worth trying.</p>

                <h2>Myth #6: All Credit Checks Hurt Your Score Equally</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> Every time anyone checks your credit, your score drops by the same amount, so minimize credit checks completely.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Credit inquiries come in two very different types with very different impacts:</p>

                <p><strong>Soft inquiries (NO impact):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checking your own credit</li>
                    <li>Pre-approved credit card offers</li>
                    <li>Employment credit checks</li>
                    <li>Insurance quotes</li>
                    <li>Background checks for apartments</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Hard inquiries (small temporary impact):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credit card applications</li>
                    <li>Mortgage applications</li>
                    <li>Auto loan applications</li>
                    <li>Personal loan applications</li>
                    <li>Student loan applications</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Rate shopping protection:</strong> Multiple hard inquiries for the same type of loan (mortgage, auto, student) within 14-45 days (depending on scoring model) count as just ONE inquiry. This lets you shop for the best rate without multiple score hits.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You're buying a car and get quotes from 5 different lenders over two weeks. All 5 hard inquiries count as one single inquiry = about 5 points off your score instead of 25 points.</p>

                <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Even hard inquiries only drop your score 5-10 points temporarily, and the impact fades within 3-6 months. They're really not worth obsessing over.</p>

                <h2>Myth #7: Paying Off Loans Immediately Boosts Your Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> The moment you make that final payment on a car loan or mortgage, your credit score jumps up significantly.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Paying off <a href="what-is-debt.html">debt</a> helps your score long-term, but the immediate effect is unpredictable and sometimes even negative temporarily. Here's why this seems backwards:</p>

                <p><strong>Why scores sometimes drop after payoff:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Credit mix reduction:</strong> If that car loan was your only installment loan and you only have credit cards now, you've reduced your credit mix (10% of score)</li>
                    <li><strong>Account closure:</strong> The loan closes, reducing your total accounts</li>
                    <li><strong>No more positive payment history:</strong> That account no longer adds fresh on-time payments monthly</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Someone with a 740 score pays off their car loan (their only installment loan). Score drops to 720 temporarily because they now only have credit cards. Over 6 months, score climbs to 750 as the benefits appear.</p>

                <p><strong>The long-term benefit:</strong> Lower debt-to-income ratio (helps with loan approvals), more available income, reduced financial stress, and eventually a higher score as your credit profile strengthens. Just don't expect an instant 50-point jump.</p>

                <p><strong>Should you still pay off debt?</strong> Absolutely yes! Pay off debt for financial freedom and reduced interest, not for an immediate score boost. The score benefits come over time.</p>

                <h2>Myth #8: You Only Have One Credit Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> There's a single, definitive credit score that all lenders see and use.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> You have dozens of different credit scores at any given time. The scoring landscape includes:</p>

                <p><strong>Major scoring models:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FICO scores:</strong> FICO 2, 4, 5 (mortgage), FICO 8 (most common), FICO 9 (newer), FICO 10 (newest), plus industry-specific versions for auto and credit cards</li>
                    <li><strong>VantageScore:</strong> VantageScore 3.0, VantageScore 4.0</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Three credit bureaus:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experian</li>
                    <li>Equifax</li>
                    <li>TransUnion</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The math:</strong> Multiple scoring models × 3 bureaus = dozens of different scores. Your FICO 8 score from Experian might be 720, while your VantageScore 3.0 from Equifax is 698, and your FICO 5 mortgage score from TransUnion is 735.</p>

                <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> The score you see on Credit Karma (VantageScore 3.0) might be 30-50 points different from the score a mortgage lender uses (FICO 5). This isn't an error - they're using different models with different data sources.</p>

                <p><strong>Which scores matter most:</strong> FICO 8 for credit cards, FICO 2/4/5 for mortgages, FICO Auto Score 8 for car loans. Focus on improving all scores by following the same basic principles - they're correlated even if numbers differ.</p>

                <h2>Myth #9: Age Affects Your Credit Score</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> Older people automatically have better credit scores simply because they're older.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Your actual age (how many years you've been alive) doesn't directly affect your score at all. What DOES matter is the age of your credit accounts - called "length of credit history."</p>

                <p><strong>What credit age actually measures:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age of your oldest account</li>
                    <li>Age of your newest account</li>
                    <li>Average age of all your accounts</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>This accounts for 15% of your FICO score.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Real examples showing age doesn't matter:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>25-year-old:</strong> Got first credit card at 18 (7 years of history). Responsible user. Score: 760</li>
                    <li><strong>40-year-old:</strong> Got first credit card at 38 (2 years of history). Perfect payment history but short history. Score: 680</li>
                    <li><strong>50-year-old:</strong> Bad credit decisions throughout life despite 30 years of history. Score: 580</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The 25-year-old has the best score because they started early and used credit responsibly. Personal age doesn't matter - credit age matters.</p>

                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> This is why financial experts recommend young people get a credit card early (even a secured card or student card) - it starts building credit age. The earlier you start, the longer your credit history.</p>

                <h2>Myth #10: Settling Debt Is as Good as Paying in Full</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> If you settle debt for less than you owe (pay $3,000 to settle a $5,000 debt), it has the same positive credit impact as paying the full $5,000.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Settled accounts are specifically noted on your credit report as "settled" or "settled for less than full balance" and damage your score, though less than unpaid accounts.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact hierarchy (best to worst):</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Paid in Full:</strong> Neutral to slightly positive impact</li>
                    <li><strong>Settled:</strong> Negative impact, but account is closed</li>
                    <li><strong>Unpaid:</strong> Severe negative impact, ongoing damage</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Why "settled" hurts:</strong> It tells future lenders "this person didn't pay what they agreed to pay." While it's better than not paying at all, lenders see it as a red flag. You saved money but damaged your credit.</p>

                <p><strong>When settling makes sense anyway:</strong> If you literally cannot pay the full amount and the alternative is bankruptcy or continued non-payment, settling is the right choice. Your credit takes a hit, but you close the account and stop accumulating interest and fees.</p>

                <p><strong>Settlement strategy:</strong> Negotiate "pay for delete" where they remove the account entirely in exchange for payment. Get it in writing before paying. This is your best outcome.</p>

                <h2>Bonus Myth #11: Debit Cards Build Credit</h2>

                <p><strong>The myth:</strong> Using a debit card responsibly builds credit just like a credit card.</p>

                <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Debit cards have ZERO impact on your credit score - positive or negative. They're not reported to credit bureaus at all because they're not credit. You're spending your own money, not borrowing.</p>

                <p><strong>What DOES build credit:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credit cards (used responsibly)</li>
                    <li>Personal loans</li>
                    <li>Auto loans</li>
                    <li>Mortgages</li>
                    <li>Student loans</li>
                    <li>Credit-builder loans</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Young people sometimes avoid credit cards entirely and only use debit, thinking they're "building credit." Years later, they discover they have no credit history at all and can't get approved for an apartment or car loan.</p>

                <h2>The Real Truth About Building Good Credit</h2>

                <p>Forget the myths and gimmicks. Good credit comes from five straightforward factors:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Payment History (35% of score) - Most Important</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay every bill on time, every single month</li>
                    <li>Set up autopay for minimum payments as backup</li>
                    <li>Even one late payment (30+ days) can drop your score 60-100 points</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>2. Credit Utilization (30% of score) - Very Important</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep total credit card balances below 30% of limits</li>
                    <li>Below 10% is ideal</li>
                    <li>$300 balance on $1,000 limit = 30% utilization</li>
                    <li>Pay balances down before statement closing date for best impact</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3. Length of Credit History (15% of score)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep old accounts open (even if unused)</li>
                    <li>Start building credit early in life</li>
                    <li>Be patient - this factor improves with time automatically</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>4. Credit Mix (10% of score)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having different types of credit (revolving and installment) helps slightly</li>
                    <li>Don't take out loans just for credit mix - not worth it</li>
                    <li>Natural mix develops over time</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>5. New Credit (10% of score)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid applying for multiple new credit accounts rapidly</li>
                    <li>Space out credit applications (6+ months apart ideally)</li>
                    <li>Only apply for credit you actually need</li>
                </ul>

                <p>That's it. No tricks, no paying interest unnecessarily, no closing accounts, no carrying balances. Just use credit responsibly and let time work in your favor. Avoid taking on <a href="good-debt-vs-bad-debt.html">bad debt</a> just to build your score.</p>

                    <ul style="margin-bottom:0">
                        <li>Checking your own credit never hurts your score - check as often as you want</li>
                        <li>Closing credit cards typically hurts your score by increasing utilization ratio</li>
                        <li>You never need to pay interest to build credit - pay full balance every month</li>
                        <li>Income doesn't affect your credit score at all - payment behavior matters</li>
                        <li>Paid collections stay on your report for 7 years from first delinquency</li>
                        <li>Soft inquiries (checking your score) have zero impact; hard inquiries (applications) have small temporary impact</li>
                        <li>You have dozens of different credit scores - the number varies by model and bureau</li>
                        <li>Your age doesn't matter, but age of credit accounts does (15% of score)</li>
                        <li>Settlement damages credit less than non-payment but more than paying in full</li>
                        <li>Focus on the five factors: payment history (35%), utilization (30%), credit age (15%), mix (10%), new credit (10%)</li>
                    </ul>
