                <p>Credit scores are often misunderstood, leading to myths that can hurt people's financial decisions. Let's clear up the most common misconceptions.</p>

<h2>Myth 1: Checking Your Credit Hurts Your Score</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Looking at your own credit score or report damages it.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Checking your own credit is a "soft inquiry" and has zero impact on your score. You can check as often as you want.</p>

<p>What DOES hurt: When lenders check your credit as part of a credit application (hard inquiry). This can drop your score 5-10 points temporarily.</p>

<h2>Myth 2: Closing Credit Cards Helps Your Score</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Closing unused credit cards improves your score by reducing available credit.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Closing cards usually hurts your score in two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduces total available credit (increases utilization)</li>
    <li>May lower average account age</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You have two cards with $5,000 limits each ($10,000 total) and $2,000 in balances = 20% utilization. If you close one card, you now have $2,000 in balances with only $5,000 in limits = 40% utilization. Your score drops.</p>

<h2>Myth 3: You Need to Carry a Balance to Build Credit</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> You must carry a balance and pay interest to improve your credit score.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Paying your full balance every month builds credit just as well as carrying a balance - and saves you money on interest. Credit scores care that you USE credit and pay on time, not that you pay interest.</p>

<h2>Myth 4: Income Affects Your Credit Score</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Making more money improves your credit score.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Income is not part of credit score calculations. Someone making $30,000 can have an 800 score, while someone making $300,000 can have a 600 score. Credit scores measure how you handle debt, not how much you earn.</p>

<h2>Myth 5: Paying Off Collections Removes Them</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Once you pay a collection account, it disappears from your report.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Paid collections stay on your report for 7 years from the date of first delinquency. They're just marked as "paid." Some newer scoring models ignore paid collections, but not all do.</p>

<h2>Myth 6: All Credit Checks Hurt Your Score Equally</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Every credit check drops your score the same amount.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Soft inquiries (checking your own score, pre-approved offers) don't affect your score at all. Hard inquiries (credit applications) cause small, temporary drops. Multiple inquiries for the same type of loan (like mortgage shopping) within 14-45 days typically count as just one inquiry.</p>

<h2>Myth 7: Paying Off Loans Immediately Boosts Your Score</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> As soon as you pay off a loan, your score jumps up.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Paying off debt helps over time, but the immediate effect varies. Sometimes closing an installment loan (car loan, mortgage) can temporarily lower your score because it reduces your credit mix. The long-term effect is positive, but don't expect an instant 50-point jump.</p>

<h2>Myth 8: You Only Have One Credit Score</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> There's a single credit score that everyone uses.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> You have dozens of credit scores. FICO alone has multiple versions, plus there's VantageScore. Different lenders use different scoring models. The score you see on a free credit monitoring app might be different from what a mortgage lender sees.</p>

<h2>Myth 9: Age Affects Your Credit Score</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Older people automatically have better credit scores.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Your age doesn't directly affect your score. What matters is the age of your credit accounts (credit history length). A 25-year-old who got a credit card at 18 might have better credit than a 40-year-old who got their first credit card last year.</p>

<h2>Myth 10: Settling Debt Is as Good as Paying in Full</h2>

<p><strong>The myth:</strong> Settling debt for less than you owe has the same credit impact as paying in full.</p>

<p><strong>The truth:</strong> Settled accounts are noted on your credit report and can hurt your score. "Settled" looks worse to lenders than "Paid in Full." While settling is better than not paying, it's not as good as paying the full amount owed.</p>

<h2>The Truth About Building Credit</h2>

<p>Good credit comes from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Paying all bills on time, every time</li>
    <li>Keeping credit card balances low</li>
    <li>Having a long credit history</li>
    <li>Using credit responsibly</li>
    <li>Not applying for too much new credit at once</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. No tricks, no games, no need to pay interest or fees to build credit.</p>
