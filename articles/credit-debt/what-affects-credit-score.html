                <p class="intro">Your credit score changes based on how you use credit and pay your bills. Some actions help your score go up, while others make it go down. Understanding what affects your score helps you make better financial decisions.</p>

                <h2>Things That Help Your Score</h2>

                <h3>Paying Bills On Time</h3>
                <p>This is the single most important thing you can do. Every on-time payment adds a positive mark to your credit history. Making the minimum payment by the due date counts as on-time.</p>

                <p>If your credit card bill is due on the 15th and you pay $25 (the minimum) by the 15th, that's good for your score. It doesn't matter if you pay the full balance or just the minimum for credit score purposes (though paying in full saves you interest money).</p>

                <h3>Keeping Balances Low</h3>
                <p>Using only a small portion of your available credit helps your score. If you have a credit card with a $2,000 limit, keeping your balance under $600 (30% of your limit) is better than carrying a $1,800 balance.</p>

                <p>This gets reported monthly when your credit card statement closes. So if you use your card throughout the month but pay it down before the statement date, the low balance gets reported.</p>

                <h3>Keeping Accounts Open</h3>
                <p>Having older credit accounts helps your score over time. An account that's been open and in good standing for 5 years is valuable because it shows a long track record of responsible use.</p>

                <p>Even if you don't use a card much, keeping it open helps by maintaining your length of credit history and your total available credit.</p>

                <h3>Having Different Types of Credit</h3>
                <p>Having both credit cards and installment loans (like a car loan) shows you can handle different types of credit. This is a small factor but does help slightly.</p>

                <h2>Things That Hurt Your Score</h2>

                <h3>Missing Payments</h3>
                <p>Late payments damage your score. Missing a payment by 30 days or more gets reported and can drop your score significantly. A 30-day late payment might lower your score by 50-100 points depending on your starting score.</p>

                <p>The damage is worse if you're consistently late. One late payment from 2 years ago on an otherwise perfect record has less impact than three late payments in the past year.</p>

                <h3>Maxing Out Credit Cards</h3>
                <p>Using all or most of your available credit hurts your score. If you have a $1,000 credit limit and regularly carry a $950 balance, that's 95% utilization and will lower your score.</p>

                <p>This happens even if you make all your payments on time. High balances signal risk to lenders.</p>

                <h3>Applying for Too Much Credit at Once</h3>
                <p>Each credit application creates a "hard inquiry" on your report. One or two inquiries over a year have minimal impact. But applying for five credit cards in one month sends up red flags and can lower your score.</p>

                <p>Each inquiry might reduce your score by 5-10 points. The effect is temporary and fades after several months, but multiple inquiries compound the damage.</p>

                <h3>Closing Old Accounts</h3>
                <p>Closing a credit card, especially an old one, can hurt your score in two ways. First, it reduces your total available credit, which can increase your utilization percentage. Second, it can lower your average account age.</p>

                <p>If you have $10,000 in total credit and owe $2,000 (20% utilization), closing a card with a $3,000 limit drops your total to $7,000. Now you're at about 29% utilization with the same debt.</p>

                <h3>Collections and Serious Delinquencies</h3>
                <p>Having an account sent to collections severely damages your score. This happens when you're very behind on payments and the original creditor gives up and sells your debt to a collection agency.</p>

                <p>Bankruptcies, foreclosures, and repossessions also cause major damage. These can drop your score by 200+ points and stay on your report for 7-10 years.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example: Actions and Impact</h2>

                <p>Jessica has a 720 credit score. Let's see how different actions might affect it:</p>

                <p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> She misses a credit card payment by 35 days. Her score drops to about 650-670. The late payment stays on her report for 7 years, though its impact lessens over time.</p>

                <p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> She keeps her credit card balance at $100 on a $5,000 limit (2% utilization) instead of $2,500 (50% utilization). Over several months, her score increases to about 740-750.</p>

                <p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> She applies for three new credit cards in one week. Her score drops to about 690-700 due to the hard inquiries and lowered average account age from the new accounts.</p>

                <h2>Things That Don't Affect Your Score</h2>

                <p>Many people think certain things impact their credit score when they actually don't. Here's what doesn't matter:</p>

                <h3>Your Income</h3>
                <p>Making $30,000 a year or $300,000 a year doesn't directly affect your credit score. Income isn't reported to credit bureaus. Lenders will ask about income separately when you apply for credit, but it's not part of your score calculation.</p>

                <h3>Your Bank Account Balances</h3>
                <p>Having $100 or $100,000 in your savings account doesn't affect your credit score. Your checking and savings accounts aren't reported to credit bureaus (unless you overdraft and it goes to collections).</p>

                <h3>Paying Rent and Utilities</h3>
                <p>In most cases, paying rent, electricity, water, or internet bills on time doesn't help your credit score. These aren't typically reported to credit bureaus. However, if you don't pay and they go to collections, that will hurt your score.</p>

                <h3>Checking Your Own Score</h3>
                <p>Looking at your own credit score or pulling your credit report is called a "soft inquiry" and has zero impact on your score. You can check as often as you want without any penalty.</p>

                <h3>Your Age</h3>
                <p>Whether you're 22 or 72 doesn't matter. What matters is how long you've had credit accounts, not how old you are as a person.</p>

                <h2>The Speed of Changes</h2>

                <p>Some factors affect your score quickly, while others take time. Credit utilization can change your score within a month or two when your new balance gets reported. Payment history builds over months and years.</p>

                <p>Recovering from negative marks takes patience. A missed payment stops hurting as much after about 2 years, but it doesn't disappear from your report for 7 years. During that time, adding positive payment history helps offset the damage.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Paying all bills on time is the most important factor for your score</li>
                    <li>Keeping credit card balances low (under 30% of your limit) helps significantly</li>
                    <li>Missing payments, maxing out cards, and applying for too much credit hurt your score</li>
                    <li>Income, bank account balances, and age don't affect your credit score</li>
                    <li>Checking your own score doesn't hurt it</li>
                    <li>Some changes happen quickly (utilization) while others take time (payment history)</li>
                </ul>
