                <p>Your <a href="what-is-credit-score.html">credit score</a> isn't static - it changes constantly based on how you use credit and manage debt. Every financial action you take related to borrowing can potentially help or hurt your score. Understanding which actions have the biggest impact helps you prioritize what matters most.</p>

                <p>This comprehensive guide breaks down everything that affects your credit score into two clear categories: things that help and things that hurt. We'll cover the magnitude of each factor's impact, how quickly changes happen, and specific actions you can take starting today to improve your score.</p>

                <p>The good news? You have more control over your credit score than you might think. Let's examine exactly what moves the needle.</p>

                <h2>Things That Help Your Credit Score (Do These)</h2>

                <h3>1. Paying On Time, Every Time (Biggest Impact)</h3>

                <p>This is the single most important thing you can do for your credit. Paying all bills by their due dates builds a strong payment history that comprises 35% of your score - the largest factor.</p>

                <p><strong>Why it matters so much:</strong> On-time payments demonstrate you're a reliable borrower. Lenders want to see consistency over time - one perfect year beats 10 mediocre years.</p>

                <p><strong>What counts as on-time:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Payment received by due date (not postmarked - actually received)</li>
                    <li>At least the minimum payment amount</li>
                    <li>Every month, without exception</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Real impact example:</strong> Someone with 5 years of perfect payment history maintains an 800 score. One missed payment drops them to 710. After 12 months of perfect payments, they're back to 770. Full recovery to 800 takes about 2 years of perfection.</p>

                <p><strong>Action steps:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set up automatic minimum payments on all <a href="what-is-credit.html">credit</a> accounts</li>
                    <li>Create calendar reminders 5 days before due dates</li>
                    <li>Pay more than minimums when possible, but never miss the minimum</li>
                    <li>Consider bi-weekly payments instead of monthly (gets ahead of due dates)</li>
                </ul>

                </div>

                <h3>2. Keeping Balances Low (Very High Impact)</h3>

                <p>Using less than 30% of your available credit (ideally less than 10%) significantly boosts your score. This is measured by your <a href="what-is-credit-utilization.html">credit utilization</a> ratio, which is 30% of your credit score.</p>

                <p><strong>How to calculate your utilization:</strong></p>
                <p>(Total credit card balances ÷ Total credit limits) × 100 = Utilization %</p>

                <p><strong>Complete example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Card 1: $500 balance on $2,000 limit</li>
                    <li>Card 2: $1,500 balance on $5,000 limit</li>
                    <li>Card 3: $0 balance on $3,000 limit</li>
                    <li><strong>Total:</strong> $2,000 balance ÷ $10,000 limits = 20% utilization (Good)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Target ranges:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Under 10%:</strong> Excellent for your score</li>
                    <li><strong>10-30%:</strong> Good, acceptable range</li>
                    <li><strong>30-50%:</strong> Fair, starting to hurt score</li>
                    <li><strong>Above 50%:</strong> Poor, significantly hurts score</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Real impact:</strong> Reducing utilization from 50% to 10% can increase your score by 40-60 points almost immediately (within 1-2 months).</p>

                <p><strong>Action steps:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay down balances aggressively - this is fast-acting</li>
                    <li>Request credit limit increases (don't increase spending)</li>
                    <li>Open a new card to increase total available credit</li>
                    <li>Pay balances before statement closes (reduces reported utilization)</li>
                    <li>Spread balances across cards rather than maxing one</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Keeping Old Accounts Open (Moderate Impact)</h3>

                <p>Older accounts increase your average account age, which helps your score (15% factor). Your credit age includes the age of your oldest account, newest account, and average age of all accounts.</p>

                <p><strong>Why age matters:</strong> Longer credit history provides more data points showing you can manage credit responsibly over time. A 10-year-old account in good standing is valuable.</p>

                <p><strong>What hurts credit age:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Closing old accounts (removes their age from your average eventually)</li>
                    <li>Opening many new accounts quickly (lowers average age)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example showing the value:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Before:</strong> Cards aged 12 years, 8 years, and 3 years = 7.7 year average</li>
                    <li><strong>After closing 12-year card:</strong> Cards aged 8 years and 3 years = 5.5 year average</li>
                    <li>You just aged your credit history younger by 2.2 years, hurting this factor</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Action steps:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never close your oldest credit card</li>
                    <li>Keep cards open even if unused (put small recurring charge like Netflix)</li>
                    <li>If a card has an annual fee, ask to downgrade to no-fee version instead of closing</li>
                    <li>Start building credit early in life - every year counts</li>
                    <li>Consider becoming authorized user on parent's old account (you inherit account age)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Having a Mix of Credit Types (Minor Impact)</h3>

                <p>A combination of revolving credit (credit cards) and installment loans (car loan, mortgage, personal loan) shows you can handle different types of credit. This is 10% of your score.</p>

                <p><strong>Why it helps:</strong> Successfully managing both types of credit demonstrates broader financial competency to lenders.</p>

                <p><strong>Types of credit:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Revolving:</strong> Credit cards, HELOCs, retail store cards</li>
                    <li><strong>Installment:</strong> Mortgages, auto loans, student loans, personal loans</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Someone with 2 credit cards + 1 auto loan + 1 mortgage gets full credit for this factor. Someone with only 3 credit cards gets partial credit.</p>

                <p><strong>Important caveat:</strong> Never take out loans you don't need just to improve credit mix. This factor is only 10% of your score. Focus on the bigger factors (payment history 35%, utilization 30%) instead.</p>

                <p><strong>Action steps:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let credit mix develop naturally as you take necessary loans</li>
                    <li>Don't stress about this factor - it's minor</li>
                    <li>If you're young with only cards, you'll naturally add installment loans as you buy a car or home</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Spacing Out Credit Applications (Minor Impact)</h3>

                <p>Limiting new credit applications shows financial stability. Each application creates a "hard inquiry" that slightly dings your score (5-10 points) and stays on your report for 2 years.</p>

                <p><strong>Why it helps:</strong> Not constantly applying for new credit suggests you're not desperately seeking credit due to financial problems.</p>

                <p><strong>Rate shopping protection:</strong> Multiple inquiries for the same loan type (mortgage, auto, student) within 14-45 days count as just one inquiry. Shop freely for best rates within this window.</p>

                <p><strong>Action steps:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Space credit applications 6+ months apart when possible</li>
                    <li>Only apply for credit you actually need</li>
                    <li>When rate shopping, do it all within a 2-week period</li>
                    <li>Check if you're pre-qualified before formally applying (soft inquiry)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Things That Hurt Your Credit Score (Avoid These)</h2>

                <h3>1. Late Payments (Devastating Impact)</h3>

                <p>Even one late payment can severely damage your score. The impact depends on how late, how often, and how recent.</p>

                <p><strong>Damage by lateness:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>30 days late:</strong> Major impact, drops score 60-110 points depending on starting score</li>
                    <li><strong>60 days late:</strong> More severe damage, harder to recover from</li>
                    <li><strong>90+ days late:</strong> Serious damage, often goes to collections</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Real damage example:</strong> Perfect 780 score, one 30-day late payment drops you to 685 (95 points). If you were applying for a mortgage, you just went from "excellent" to "good" rates - costing you potentially $50,000+ in extra interest over 30 years.</p>

                <p><strong>How long it stays:</strong> Late payments remain on your credit report for 7 years from the date of the delinquency, though their impact fades over time.</p>

                <p><strong>Recovery timeline:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Month 1-6:</strong> Severe impact, score significantly suppressed</li>
                    <li><strong>Month 6-12:</strong> Impact moderating, score recovering slowly</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 2-3:</strong> Impact diminishing, score mostly recovered with perfect subsequent payments</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 7:</strong> Falls off report completely</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. High Credit Utilization (Severe Impact)</h3>

                <p>Using most or all of your available credit signals financial stress to lenders and tanks your score quickly.</p>

                <p><strong>Why high utilization hurts:</strong> It suggests you're living beyond your means and may struggle to repay new <a href="what-is-debt.html">debt</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Example of damage:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Card with $5,000 limit</li>
                    <li>Carrying $4,500 balance = 90% utilization</li>
                    <li>Your score drops 40-80 points from this alone</li>
                    <li>Pay down to $500 (10% utilization) and score rebounds 40-80 points</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The good news:</strong> Utilization has no memory. Lower your balances and your score improves within 1-2 months. This is the fastest way to improve your score.</p>

                <h3>3. Closing Old Accounts (Moderate-Severe Impact)</h3>

                <p>Closing credit cards hurts in two ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Reduces total available credit, which increases your utilization ratio</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-term:</strong> Eventually removes account age from your credit history</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Damage example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Before closing:</strong> $2,000 balance on $10,000 total credit = 20% utilization, 760 score</li>
                    <li><strong>Close card with $5,000 limit:</strong> $2,000 balance on $5,000 remaining credit = 40% utilization</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Score drops to 720 (40 points from one action)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Maxing Out Credit Cards (Severe Impact)</h3>

                <p>Using 100% of your credit limit, even if you pay it off monthly, can hurt your score because credit card issuers report balances on specific dates (usually statement closing date).</p>

                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If your statement closes with a maxed card, that 100% utilization gets reported to credit bureaus even if you pay it off the next day.</p>

                <p><strong>Strategic fix:</strong> Pay down balances BEFORE your statement closes. The lower balance gets reported, improving your utilization.</p>

                <h3>5. Collections and Charge-Offs (Devastating Impact)</h3>

                <p>Accounts sent to collections or charged off as uncollectible severely damage your score and stay on your report for 7 years.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collection account can drop score 50-150 points</li>
                    <li>Multiple collections compound the damage</li>
                    <li>Even paid collections hurt (though less than unpaid)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 7 years from the date of first delinquency (when you first fell behind on the original account, not when it went to collections).</p>

                <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Negotiate "pay for delete" where possible - offer to pay if they remove it from your report entirely. Get agreement in writing before paying.</p>

                <h3>6. Bankruptcy (Most Destructive Impact)</h3>

                <p>The most damaging event for credit scores. Can drop scores 200+ points instantly.</p>

                <p><strong>Types and duration:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chapter 7 bankruptcy:</strong> Stays on report 10 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Chapter 13 bankruptcy:</strong> Stays on report 7 years</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Recovery:</strong> While bankruptcy devastates credit initially, responsible behavior after bankruptcy can rebuild scores to 700+ within 2-4 years.</p>

                <h3>7. Multiple Hard Inquiries in Short Time (Moderate Impact)</h3>

                <p>Each credit application creates a "hard inquiry" that drops your score 5-10 points and stays on your report for 2 years (though impact only lasts 3-12 months).</p>

                <p><strong>Damage example:</strong> Apply for 4 credit cards in one month = 20-40 point score drop. Looks desperate to lenders.</p>

                <p><strong>Exception:</strong> Multiple inquiries for the same loan type within 14-45 days (mortgage shopping, car loan shopping) count as one inquiry.</p>

                <h2>How Fast Changes Happen (Timeline)</h2>

                <h3>Quick Score Drops (Immediate to 1-2 Months)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Late payment reports:</strong> Score drops within 30 days of reporting</li>
                    <li><strong>Maxed credit cards:</strong> Score drops as soon as new balance reports (monthly)</li>
                    <li><strong>New collections:</strong> Score drops within 30-60 days of reporting</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard inquiries:</strong> Score drops within days of application</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Quick Score Increases (1-2 Months)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Paying down balances:</strong> Score improves as soon as lower utilization reports (monthly)</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit limit increase:</strong> Improves utilization, score increases within 30-60 days</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Slow Score Building (6 Months to Years)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Payment history:</strong> Consistent on-time payments build score gradually over 6-12 months</li>

                <h2>What Doesn't Affect Your Score (Common Misconceptions)</h2>

                <p>Many people think these factors affect credit scores, but they don't:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your income:</strong> Not reported to credit bureaus, not in the formula</li>
                    <li><strong>Your savings or assets:</strong> Having $100,000 in the bank doesn't help your score</li>
                    <li><strong>Your job or employment history:</strong> Not part of credit scoring</li>
                    <li><strong>Checking your own score:</strong> "Soft inquiries" don't affect your score at all</li>
                    <li><strong>Your age, race, gender, or marital status:</strong> Illegal to use in credit scoring</li>
                    <li><strong>Where you live:</strong> Your address doesn't affect score directly</li>
                    <li><strong>Debit card use:</strong> Debit cards aren't credit, so they don't build or hurt scores</li>
                    <li><strong>Salary increases or bonuses:</strong> Income changes don't affect credit scores</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Understanding these factors helps you avoid following bad advice. Many of the misconceptions people have about credit are addressed in our article on <a href="credit-score-myths.html">credit score myths</a>.</p>

                    <ul style="margin-bottom:0">
                        <li>Payment history (35%) and credit utilization (30%) are the two biggest factors - focus on these first</li>
                        <li>One 30-day late payment can drop your score 60-110 points and takes 18-24 months to fully recover</li>
                        <li>High utilization hurts immediately, but paying down balances improves score within 1-2 months</li>
                        <li>Closing old credit cards hurts by increasing utilization and lowering average account age</li>
                        <li>Collections, charge-offs, and bankruptcy cause severe long-term damage (7-10 years)</li>
                        <li>Credit age builds automatically over time - keep old accounts open</li>
                        <li>Hard inquiries drop score 5-10 points each but impact fades within 3-12 months</li>
                        <li>Rate shopping protection: Multiple inquiries for same loan within 14-45 days count as one</li>
                        <li>Income, age, checking your own score, and debit card use don't affect your credit score</li>
                        <li>Quick drops (late payments) take months to recover; quick improvements (lower utilization) happen in 1-2 months</li>
                    </ul>
