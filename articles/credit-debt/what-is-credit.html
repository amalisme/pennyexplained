                <p>When you use a credit card at a store or take out a car loan, you're using credit. It's one of the most common financial tools in modern life, but many people don't fully understand how it works.</p>

<h2>How Credit Works</h2>
<p>The basic credit process works like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>You ask to borrow money or buy something on credit</li>
    <li>The lender checks if they can trust you to repay</li>
    <li>If approved, you get the money or item now</li>
    <li>You agree to pay it back, usually with <a href="what-is-interest.html">interest</a></li>
    <li>You make payments over time until fully repaid</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You use a credit card to buy a $500 laptop. The credit card company pays the store $500 immediately. You now owe the credit card company $500, which you'll pay back over time (plus interest if you don't pay in full by the due date).</p>

<h2>Types of Credit</h2>

<h3>Revolving Credit</h3>
<p>You have a credit limit and can borrow up to that amount repeatedly as you pay it back:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Credit cards</li>
    <li>Home equity lines of credit</li>
    <li>Personal lines of credit</li>
</ul>

<p>With revolving credit, your <a href="what-is-credit-utilization.html">credit utilization</a> - how much you're using compared to your limit - directly impacts your credit score.</p>

<h3>Installment Credit</h3>
<p>You borrow a fixed amount once and pay it back in set payments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Car loans</li>
    <li>Mortgages</li>
    <li>Student loans</li>
    <li>Personal loans</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Credit Exists</h2>
<p>Credit allows people to make major purchases they couldn't afford to pay for all at once. Without credit, most people couldn't buy homes or cars because few have $30,000-300,000 in cash sitting around.</p>

<p>For lenders, credit is a business. They make money by charging interest on the money they lend. The interest is their profit for taking the risk of lending. However, it's important to understand the difference between <a href="good-debt-vs-bad-debt.html">good debt and bad debt</a> when deciding to use credit.</p>

<h2>Building Credit</h2>
<p>When you use credit responsibly - borrowing and paying back as agreed - you build a credit history. This history shows future lenders that you're trustworthy with borrowed money.</p>

<p>Good credit opens doors to better interest rates, which saves you thousands of dollars over time. Your <a href="what-is-credit-score.html">credit score</a> is a three-digit number that summarizes this trustworthiness. It can also affect your ability to rent apartments, get utilities without deposits, and even some job opportunities.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between using credit wisely and taking on too much <a href="what-is-debt.html">debt</a> is essential for financial health. When managed properly, credit can be a helpful financial tool rather than a burden.</p>
