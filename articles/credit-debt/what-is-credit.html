                <p class="intro">Credit is the ability to borrow money or access goods and services with the understanding that you'll pay later. It's basically trust in financial form.</p>

                <p>When someone gives you credit, they're trusting that you'll pay them back. This could be a bank lending you money, a credit card company letting you make purchases, or even a landlord renting you an apartment.</p>

                <h2>How Credit Works</h2>
                
                <p>Think of credit like this: you want to buy something that costs $500, but you only have $100 right now. A credit card company says "we trust you'll pay us back, so go ahead and buy it." You make the purchase, and now you owe the credit card company $500.</p>

                <p>You agree to pay them back over time. If you pay back the full $500 before the due date, you don't pay any extra. If you take longer, you'll pay interest on top of what you borrowed.</p>

                <h2>Common Types of Credit</h2>

                <h3>Credit Cards</h3>
                <p>Credit cards let you borrow money up to a certain limit for purchases. You get a bill each month showing what you owe. You can pay the full amount or make smaller payments over time.</p>

                <p>For example, if your credit limit is $3,000, you can make purchases up to that amount. Each time you pay down your balance, that credit becomes available again.</p>

                <h3>Loans</h3>
                <p>A loan is when you borrow a specific amount of money and agree to pay it back over a set time period. This includes car loans, student loans, and personal loans.</p>

                <p>If you take out a $10,000 car loan with a 5-year term, you'd make monthly payments for 60 months until the loan is paid off. Each payment covers part of what you borrowed plus interest.</p>

                <h3>Lines of Credit</h3>
                <p>A line of credit works like a credit card but usually has a higher limit. You can borrow what you need up to your limit, pay it back, and borrow again.</p>

                <h2>Why Credit Matters</h2>

                <p>Credit affects several parts of your financial life. Landlords check credit before approving rental applications. Employers sometimes review credit during the hiring process. Phone companies use it to decide if you need to pay a deposit.</p>

                <p>Most importantly, having good credit makes borrowing money cheaper. Someone with good credit might get a car loan at 4% interest, while someone with poor credit might pay 12% interest for the same loan.</p>

                <h2>Building Credit</h2>

                <p>When you use credit responsibly, you build a positive credit history. This means making payments on time, not borrowing more than you can afford to pay back, and keeping your debt manageable.</p>

                <p>Your credit history gets tracked and becomes your credit score, which we'll explain in other articles. For now, just know that how you use credit today affects what opportunities you'll have tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example</h2>

                <p>Sarah gets her first credit card with a $1,000 limit. She uses it to buy $200 worth of groceries and gas. When her bill comes, she has two choices.</p>

                <p>She can pay the full $200 before the due date and owe nothing extra. Or she can pay just the minimum payment of $25 and carry the remaining $175 to next month, which will add interest charges to what she owes.</p>

                <p>If Sarah pays on time every month and doesn't max out her card, she's building good credit. If she misses payments or always carries a high balance, she's building poor credit.</p>

                <h2>Credit vs. Debit</h2>

                <p>Credit is different from using a debit card. With a debit card, you're spending money you already have in your bank account. With credit, you're borrowing money you'll need to pay back later.</p>

                <p>If you have $500 in your checking account and use your debit card to buy something for $100, you now have $400 left. If you use a credit card for that same $100 purchase, you still have $500 in your account, but you owe the credit card company $100.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                </ul>
