                <p>Credit scores aren't random numbers assigned arbitrarily - they're calculated using specific, measurable factors from your credit report. The formula weighs different aspects of how you've handled <a href="what-is-credit.html">credit</a> over time, creating a three-digit number that lenders use to predict how likely you are to repay borrowed money.</p>

                <p>Understanding exactly how credit scores work is like learning the rules of a game you're already playing. Once you know how scoring works, you can make strategic decisions that improve your score faster and avoid mistakes that tank it. This isn't about gaming the system - it's about understanding what lenders actually care about.</p>

                <p>This comprehensive guide breaks down the five factors that determine your FICO score (the most widely used credit scoring model), shows you real examples of how each factor works, and explains what actions help or hurt your score most.</p>

                <h2>The Credit Score Formula: Five Factors</h2>

                <p>FICO scores (ranging from 300-850) are calculated using five weighted categories. Some factors matter much more than others - payment history and credit utilization together account for 65% of your score.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top:0">FICO Score Breakdown</h3>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom:0">
                        <li><strong>Payment History:</strong> 35%</li>
                        <li><strong>Credit Utilization:</strong> 30%</li>
                        <li><strong>Length of Credit History:</strong> 15%</li>
                        <li><strong>Credit Mix:</strong> 10%</li>
                        <li><strong>New Credit:</strong> 10%</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Let's break down each factor in detail with real examples showing how they affect your score.</p>

                <div class="ad-container">
                    <div class="ad-placeholder ad-rectangle">Advertisement - Rectangle (300x250)</div>
                </div>

                <h2>Factor 1: Payment History (35% - Most Important)</h2>

                <p>This is the single biggest factor in your credit score. It tracks whether you pay bills on time, how late payments were, and how recently late payments occurred.</p>

                <h3>What Payment History Includes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>On-time payments on credit cards, loans, mortgages</li>
                    <li>Late payments (30, 60, 90, or 120+ days late)</li>
                    <li>Collections accounts</li>
                    <li>Public records (bankruptcies, foreclosures, tax liens)</li>
                    <li>The severity, frequency, and recency of any problems</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How Late Payments Damage Your Score</h3>

                <p><strong>The impact depends on your starting score:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>780 score + one 30-day late:</strong> Drops 90-110 points to 670-690</li>
                    <li><strong>680 score + one 30-day late:</strong> Drops 60-80 points to 600-620</li>
                    <li><strong>60-day late payment:</strong> Damages more severely than 30-day</li>
                    <li><strong>90+ day late:</strong> Even more severe, may go to collections</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Recency matters hugely:</strong> A late payment from 3 years ago hurts less than one from 3 months ago. Late payments stay on your report for 7 years, but their impact diminishes over time.</p>

                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Sarah has excellent 780 credit. She misses one credit card payment during a chaotic move and pays 32 days late. Her score drops to 685 (95-point drop). After paying on time for 6 months, her score recovers to 740. After 2 years of perfect payments, she's back to 780. The late payment still shows on her report but matters less as it ages.</p>

                <h3>How to Build Strong Payment History</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Set up autopay for minimums:</strong> Never miss a payment accidentally</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay everything on time, every time:</strong> Even one late payment causes significant damage</li>
                    <li><strong>Get current and stay current:</strong> If you have late payments, the best thing you can do is start paying on time now</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider payment reminders:</strong> Calendar alerts 3 days before due dates</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Utility bills, rent, and phone bills typically aren't reported to credit bureaus unless they go to collections. However, some newer services report rent payments, which can help build credit.</p>

                <h2>Factor 2: Credit Utilization (30% - Very Important)</h2>

                <p>This measures how much of your available credit you're actually using. It's the second-most important factor and one of the fastest ways to improve your score.</p>

                <h3>How to Calculate Your Credit Utilization</h3>

                <p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Total Credit Card Balances) ÷ (Total Credit Limits) × 100 = Utilization %</p>

                <p><strong>Complete example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Card 1:</strong> $500 balance, $2,000 limit</li>
                    <li><strong>Card 2:</strong> $1,000 balance, $3,000 limit</li>
                    <li><strong>Card 3:</strong> $0 balance, $5,000 limit</li>
                    <li><strong>Total:</strong> $1,500 balances ÷ $10,000 limits = 15% utilization ✓ Good</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Utilization Ranges and Score Impact</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>0-9%:</strong> Excellent - best for your score</li>
                    <li><strong>10-29%:</strong> Good - acceptable range</li>
                    <li><strong>30-49%:</strong> Fair - starting to hurt your score</li>
                    <li><strong>50-74%:</strong> Poor - significant negative impact</li>
                    <li><strong>75-100%:</strong> Very Poor - maxed out cards tank your score</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Real-world impact example:</strong> Mike has a 720 score with $3,000 balance on $10,000 total credit (30% utilization). He pays down to $1,000 balance (10% utilization). His score jumps to 760 - a 40-point increase from this one change. Understanding <a href="what-is-credit-utilization.html">credit utilization</a> is key to maintaining a good score.</p>

                <h3>Per-Card Utilization Also Matters</h3>

                <p>Not only does total utilization matter, but utilization on individual cards matters too. Having one maxed-out card hurts even if your overall utilization is low.</p>

                <p><strong>Example showing the problem:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> Card 1: $500/$5,000 (10%), Card 2: $500/$5,000 (10%) = 10% overall ✓ Great</li>
                    <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> Card 1: $0/$5,000 (0%), Card 2: $1,000/$5,000 (20%) = 10% overall but worse score than Scenario A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Spreading balances across cards is better than concentrating them on one card.</p>

                <h3>The Timing Trick</h3>

                <p>Credit cards report to bureaus on your statement closing date, not your due date. You can pay down balances before the statement closes to report lower utilization.</p>

                <p><strong>Strategic example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You spend $3,000 monthly on your card (limit: $5,000)</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad strategy:</strong> Let statement close showing $3,000 (60% utilization reported)</li>
                    <li><strong>Good strategy:</strong> Pay $2,500 before statement closes, so statement only shows $500 (10% utilization reported), then pay remaining $500 before due date</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You still pay in full and avoid interest, but you report lower utilization to credit bureaus.</p>

                <h2>Factor 3: Length of Credit History (15%)</h2>

                <p>This measures how long you've had credit accounts. Longer credit history generally means better score because there's more data to analyze.</p>

                <h3>What Credit History Length Includes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age of oldest account:</strong> Your first credit card or loan</li>
                    <li><strong>Age of newest account:</strong> Your most recently opened account</li>
                    <li><strong>Average age of all accounts:</strong> All accounts combined</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Real Examples Showing Impact</h3>

                <p><strong>Profile A (Excellent):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oldest account: 12 years old</li>
                    <li>Newest account: 2 years old</li>
                    <li>Average age: 7 years</li>
                    <li>Strong credit history length contributes positively</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Profile B (Limited):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oldest account: 1.5 years old</li>
                    <li>Newest account: 6 months old</li>
                    <li>Average age: 1 year</li>
                    <li>Short credit history limits score, even with perfect payment history</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Closing Old Cards Hurts</h3>

                <p>When you close an account, it eventually falls off your credit report (after 10 years for accounts in good standing). This can hurt your average age of accounts.</p>

                <p><strong>Example showing the damage:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Before closing:</strong> Three cards aged 10 years, 5 years, and 2 years = 5.7 year average</li>
                    <li><strong>After closing 10-year card:</strong> Two cards aged 5 years and 2 years = 3.5 year average</li>
                    <li>Average age dropped 2.2 years, hurting this factor of your score</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How Young People Can Build This Factor</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start early:</strong> Get a credit card at 18 (student card or secured card)</li>
                    <li><strong>Become an authorized user:</strong> Parents can add you to their old card (you inherit the account age)</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep old accounts open:</strong> Don't close your first card even if you don't use it</li>
                    <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> This factor improves automatically with time</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Factor 4: Credit Mix (10%)</h2>

                <p>Having different types of credit shows lenders you can manage various account types responsibly. This is a minor factor, but it can help.</p>

                <h3>Types of Credit Accounts</h3>

                <p><strong>Revolving credit:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credit cards</li>
                    <li>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)</li>
                    <li>Retail store cards</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Installment credit:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mortgages</li>
                    <li>Auto loans</li>
                    <li>Student loans</li>
                    <li>Personal loans</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Impact on Your Score</h3>

                <p><strong>Profile A (Good Mix):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 credit cards + 1 auto loan + 1 mortgage</li>
                    <li>Shows ability to manage both revolving and installment credit</li>
                    <li>Gets full 10% credit for this factor</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Profile B (Limited Mix):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 credit cards only</li>
                    <li>Only revolving credit, no installment loans</li>
                    <li>Gets partial credit for this factor</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Should You Get Loans Just for Credit Mix?</h3>

                <p><strong>No.</strong> Never take on <a href="what-is-debt.html">debt</a> you don't need just to improve credit mix. This factor is only 10% of your score. The other 90% (especially payment history and utilization) matter far more.</p>

                <p>Credit mix naturally improves over time as you take out necessary loans (car, home, etc.). Focus on the bigger factors first.</p>

                <h2>Factor 5: New Credit (10%)</h2>

                <p>Opening too many accounts quickly signals financial stress to lenders. This factor tracks how often you apply for and open new credit.</p>

                <h3>What New Credit Includes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hard inquiries:</strong> When you apply for credit (stays on report 2 years, affects score 3-12 months)</li>
                    <li><strong>Number of new accounts:</strong> Accounts opened in past 12-24 months</li>
                    <li><strong>Time since last account opening:</strong> How recent was your most recent new account</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Hard Inquiry Impact</h3>

                <p>Each hard inquiry typically drops your score by 5-10 points. The impact is temporary and fades within months, disappearing entirely after a year.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You apply for 3 credit cards in one month (trying to maximize rewards). You get 3 hard inquiries = 15-30 point score drop. Your score recovers over the next 6-12 months as inquiries age.</p>

                <h3>Rate Shopping Exception (Important!)</h3>

                <p>Multiple inquiries for the same loan type within a short window (14-45 days, depending on scoring model) count as just ONE inquiry. This lets you shop for the best mortgage or auto loan rate without destroying your score.</p>

                <p><strong>Smart example:</strong> You're buying a house and get quotes from 6 different mortgage lenders over 3 weeks. All 6 hard inquiries count as ONE inquiry = 5-10 point drop instead of 30-60 points.</p>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> This only works for the same loan type. Shopping for a mortgage + credit card + auto loan all in one month = 3 separate inquiries, no special treatment.</p>

                <h2>How Lenders Use Your Credit Score</h2>

                <h3>Interest Rates (The Big Impact)</h3>

                <p>Your credit score directly affects what <a href="what-is-interest.html">interest rate</a> you're offered. Higher scores get lower rates, saving thousands over the life of loans.</p>

                <p><strong>Real mortgage example (30-year, $300,000 loan):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>760+ score:</strong> 6.5% rate = $1,896/month payment = $682,632 total paid</li>
                    <li><strong>620 score:</strong> 8.5% rate = $2,307/month payment = $830,520 total paid</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost of lower score:</strong> $147,888 more paid over 30 years</li>
                </ul>

                <p>That's nearly $150,000 in extra interest because of a lower credit score. This is why credit matters so much.</p>

                <h3>Approval Decisions</h3>

                <p>Credit scores help determine if you get approved at all:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excellent (740+):</strong> Approved for almost anything at best rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Good (670-739):</strong> Approved for most things at competitive rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Fair (580-669):</strong> May be denied or approved at higher rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor (below 580):</strong> Often denied, must improve credit first</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Other Uses of Credit Scores</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Insurance premiums:</strong> Many insurers use credit-based insurance scores (higher credit = lower premiums)</li>
                    <li><strong>Rental applications:</strong> Landlords check credit to evaluate tenant reliability</li>
                    <li><strong>Utility deposits:</strong> Poor credit may require deposits for utilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment:</strong> Some employers check credit for jobs involving money handling (with your permission)</li>
                    <li><strong>Cell phone plans:</strong> Lower credit might require deposits or prepaid plans</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Doesn't Affect Your Credit Score</h2>

                <p>Many people think these factors affect credit scores, but they don't:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your income:</strong> Someone earning $40K can have 800 credit; someone earning $300K can have 580 credit. Income isn't in the formula.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your savings or assets:</strong> Having $100,000 in the bank doesn't affect your score</li>
                    <li><strong>Your age, race, gender, or marital status:</strong> Illegal to use these factors</li>
                    <li><strong>Where you live:</strong> Your address doesn't matter (though cost of living affects your ability to pay bills)</li>
                    <li><strong>Your job or employment history:</strong> Not part of credit scoring</li>
                    <li><strong>Checking your own score:</strong> Soft inquiries don't affect your score</li>
                    <li><strong>Debit card use:</strong> Debit cards aren't credit, so they don't build credit</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Many people are surprised to learn their <a href="../finance-basics/what-is-income.html">income</a> doesn't directly affect their credit score - it's all about how you manage the credit you have, not how much money you make.</p>

                        <li><strong>Payment History (35%):</strong> Set up autopay for minimums, never miss a payment</li>
                        <li><strong>Utilization (30%):</strong> Pay balances down below 30%, ideally below 10%</li>
                        <li><strong>Time (15%):</strong> Keep old accounts open, start building credit early</li>
                        <li><strong>Be patient with minor factors:</strong> Mix (10%) and new credit (10%) matter less</li>

                    <h3 style="margin-top:0">Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom:0">
                        <li>Credit scores use 5 factors: Payment history (35%), utilization (30%), history length (15%), credit mix (10%), new credit (10%)</li>
                        <li>Payment history is most important - one 30-day late payment can drop score 60-110 points</li>
                        <li>Credit utilization under 30% is good, under 10% is ideal - this is fastest factor to improve</li>
                        <li>Closing old credit cards hurts by reducing available credit (increases utilization) and average account age</li>
                        <li>Income, age, and checking your own score don't affect your credit score</li>
                        <li>Rate shopping (multiple inquiries for same loan type in 14-45 days) counts as one inquiry</li>
                        <li>Higher credit scores save thousands on interest - 760 vs 620 score = $147,888 more paid on $300K mortgage</li>
                        <li>Focus improvement efforts on payment history and utilization - these two factors are 65% of your score</li>
                        <li>Credit mix and new credit matter less (10% each) - don't take on debt just to improve these factors</li>
                        <li>Understanding how scores work lets you make strategic decisions to improve yours faster</li>
                    </ul>
