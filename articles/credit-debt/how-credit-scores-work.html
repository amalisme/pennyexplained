                <p class="intro">Your credit score is calculated using information from your credit reports. These reports track how you've used credit over time, and mathematical formulas turn that information into a three-digit number.</p>

                <p>Think of credit scores like a recipe. Different ingredients go in, each with its own importance, and the result is your final score. Understanding what goes into the recipe helps you know which actions matter most.</p>

                <h2>The Five Main Factors</h2>
                
                <p>Most credit scores use five categories of information. Each category counts for a different percentage of your overall score. Here's how they break down:</p>

                <h3>Payment History (35%)</h3>
                <p>This is the biggest factor. Payment history looks at whether you pay your bills on time. Every time you make a payment on a credit card, loan, or other credit account, it gets reported.</p>

                <p>If you have a credit card with a $50 minimum payment due on the 15th of the month and you pay it by the 15th, that's a positive mark. If you pay on the 20th (5 days late), that's still usually okay. But if you're 30 days late, that's reported as a missed payment and hurts your score.</p>

                <p>One missed payment can drop your score by 50-100 points, depending on your score before the miss. The impact lessens over time, but the late payment stays on your report for 7 years.</p>

                <h3>Credit Utilization (30%)</h3>
                <p>This measures how much of your available credit you're using. It's the second most important factor. If you have a credit card with a $1,000 limit and you're carrying a $300 balance, you're using 30% of your available credit.</p>

                <p>Lower utilization is better. Most experts say keeping your utilization under 30% is good, and under 10% is even better. If you have three credit cards with a combined limit of $10,000 and you're using $2,000 total, that's 20% utilization.</p>

                <p>Credit utilization updates monthly when your credit card company reports your balance. This means it can change quickly, both up and down.</p>

                <h3>Length of Credit History (15%)</h3>
                <p>This looks at how long you've had credit accounts. Two things matter here: the age of your oldest account and the average age of all your accounts.</p>

                <p>Someone who opened their first credit card 10 years ago has a longer credit history than someone who opened their first card 6 months ago. The longer history usually means a higher score, assuming the accounts are in good standing.</p>

                <p>If you have three credit cards opened 5 years ago, 3 years ago, and 1 year ago, your average account age is 3 years. Opening new accounts lowers this average.</p>

                <h3>Credit Mix (10%)</h3>
                <p>Credit mix refers to having different types of credit accounts. The main types are revolving credit (like credit cards) and installment loans (like car loans or student loans).</p>

                <p>Having both types can help your score slightly. For example, someone with two credit cards and a car loan has a better mix than someone with only credit cards. But this is a small factor, so you shouldn't take on debt just to improve your mix.</p>

                <h3>New Credit (10%)</h3>
                <p>This category looks at recently opened accounts and recent credit applications. When you apply for new credit, the lender checks your credit report. This is called a "hard inquiry."</p>

                <p>Each hard inquiry can lower your score by a few points, usually 5-10. The impact is temporary and fades after a few months. Multiple inquiries for the same type of loan (like mortgage shopping) within a short period count as just one inquiry.</p>

                <p>Opening several new credit accounts in a short time can signal risk to lenders and lower your score.</p>

                <h2>How Information Gets Reported</h2>

                <p>Credit card companies, banks, and lenders send your account information to credit bureaus. The three main bureaus are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. They collect and maintain your credit reports.</p>

                <p>These reports include your personal information, list of credit accounts, payment history, and public records like bankruptcies. Scoring companies like FICO and VantageScore use this information to calculate your score.</p>

                <p>Not all lenders report to all three bureaus. This is why your score might be slightly different depending on which bureau's report is used.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example</h2>

                <p>Let's look at two people to see how these factors work together:</p>

                <p><strong>Person A:</strong> Has had one credit card for 8 years. Never missed a payment. Credit limit is $5,000, typically carries a $500 balance (10% utilization). Recently applied for a car loan. Score: around 780.</p>

                <p><strong>Person B:</strong> Has three credit cards opened in the last year. Missed two payments last year. Combined credit limit is $8,000, carrying $6,000 in balances (75% utilization). Applied for two new cards last month. Score: around 590.</p>

                <p>Person A's score is high because they excel at the two biggest factors (payment history and utilization). Person B's score is low because they struggle with these same factors, and the recent applications don't help.</p>

                <h2>Time and Your Score</h2>

                <p>Credit scores change over time. Positive information helps your score, and negative information hurts it. But negative items have less impact as they age.</p>

                <p>A missed payment from 5 years ago affects your score less than a missed payment from last month. Most negative information stays on your report for 7 years, then disappears. Bankruptcies can stay for 7-10 years.</p>

                <p>This means you can recover from past mistakes. Someone with a 550 score from past problems can rebuild to 700+ over a few years with consistent good behavior.</p>

                <h2>What Doesn't Affect Your Score</h2>

                <p>Some things people think matter actually don't affect credit scores at all. Your income doesn't impact your score. Neither does your savings account balance, checking account activity, or how much money you make.</p>

                <p>Paying rent or utilities on time usually doesn't help your score (unless you use a service that specifically reports this). Checking your own credit score or report doesn't hurt it either.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
