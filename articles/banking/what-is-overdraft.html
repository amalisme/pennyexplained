                <p>An overdraft happens when you try to spend more money than your <a href="checking-vs-savings-account.html">checking account</a> balance. Instead of declining the transaction, the bank covers it and charges you a fee. This creates a negative balance - you owe the bank money.</p>

                <p>Think of it like borrowing money you didn't ask for at a very high cost. Overdraft fees are one of the most expensive <a href="common-bank-fees-explained.html">bank fees</a> you can face.</p>

                <h2>How Overdraft Works</h2>
                <p>When you overdraft, here's what happens step by step:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>You attempt a transaction that exceeds your available balance</li>
                    <li>The bank decides whether to approve or decline it</li>
                    <li>If approved, the bank covers the shortage</li>
                    <li>Your account goes negative by the amount you overspent</li>
                    <li>The bank charges an overdraft fee (typically $25-35)</li>
                    <li>You must repay both the negative balance and the fee</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have $50 in your account and buy groceries for $75. The bank approves the purchase. Your balance becomes -$25 (you're $25 in the hole). The bank then charges a $35 overdraft fee, making your balance -$60. You now owe the bank $60.</p>

                <h2>The Cost of Overdrafts</h2>
                <p>Overdraft fees are expensive and can multiply quickly. Most banks charge $25-35 per overdraft transaction, not per day. This means multiple purchases on the same day can result in multiple fees.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have $20 in your account and make these purchases in one day: coffee ($5), lunch ($12), gas ($40), and groceries ($35). All four transactions overdraw your account. You're charged $35 for each = $140 in overdraft fees, plus you're $72 in the hole. Total amount you owe: $212.</p>

                <h3>Extended Overdraft Fees</h3>
                <p>Some banks charge additional fees if your account stays negative for several days. These "extended overdraft fees" can be $15-35 every few days your balance remains negative.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your account is -$50. After 5 days, the bank charges a $15 extended overdraft fee. After another 5 days, they charge another $15. Your negative balance grows even though you haven't spent anything.</p>

                <h2>Overdraft vs. Declined Transaction</h2>
                <p>You might wonder why the bank doesn't just decline the transaction instead of charging you a huge fee. The answer is: they can, and you can choose this option.</p>

                <p>Banks must ask if you want "overdraft coverage" for debit card and ATM transactions. If you decline (opt out), these transactions are simply rejected when you don't have enough money - no fee charged. If you opt in, the bank covers the transaction and charges the overdraft fee.</p>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Even if you opt out of overdraft coverage, checks and automatic bill payments can still overdraw your account and trigger fees. Only debit card purchases and ATM withdrawals are protected by opting out.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Overdraft Protection</h2>
                <p>Overdraft protection is a service that links your checking account to another account (usually savings, another checking account, or a credit card). When you're about to overdraft, the bank automatically transfers money from the linked account to cover the shortage.</p>

                <h3>How Overdraft Protection Works</h3>
                <p>Instead of charging a $35 overdraft fee, the bank transfers money from your linked account and charges a smaller transfer fee (typically $10-12). This is cheaper than a full overdraft fee but still costs money.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have $30 in checking and $500 in <a href="checking-vs-savings-account.html">savings</a>. You spend $50. Instead of overdrafting, the bank transfers $20 from savings to checking and charges a $10 transfer fee. Your checking has $0, your savings has $480, and you paid $10 instead of $35.</p>

                <h3>Types of Overdraft Protection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linked savings account:</strong> Most common and cheapest option</li>
                    <li><strong>Linked checking account:</strong> Transfer from a second checking account</li>
                    <li><strong>Line of credit:</strong> Bank provides a small loan at high interest rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit card:</strong> Shortage is charged to your credit card as a cash advance (with fees and high interest)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Overdrafts Happen</h2>
                <p>Understanding why overdrafts occur helps you prevent them. Common causes include:</p>

                <h3>Not Tracking Your Balance</h3>
                <p>You think you have more money than you actually do. Without checking your balance regularly, it's easy to lose track of spending.</p>

                <h3>Pending Transactions</h3>
                <p>You see $100 in your account, but forget that a $75 check you wrote is still pending. When it processes, you only have $25 available.</p>

                <h3>Automatic Payments</h3>
                <p>Subscriptions, gym memberships, and bill payments withdraw automatically. If you forget about them or don't have enough money when they hit, you overdraft.</p>

                <h3>Holds on Debit Card Purchases</h3>
                <p>Hotels and gas stations often place temporary holds for more than the final amount. A $30 gas purchase might show as a $75 hold initially, tying up more money than you expect.</p>

                <h3>Bank Processing Order</h3>
                <p>Some banks process larger transactions before smaller ones, which can maximize overdraft fees. If you have $100 and make purchases of $90, $20, and $30, processing the $90 first causes two overdrafts instead of one.</p>

                <h2>How to Avoid Overdrafts</h2>

                <h3>Track Your Balance Daily</h3>
                <p>Check your account every morning using your bank's mobile app. Know exactly how much money you have before spending. This simple habit prevents most overdrafts.</p>

                <h3>Set Up Low Balance Alerts</h3>
                <p>Most banks let you set alerts when your balance drops below a certain amount (like $50 or $100). You'll get a text or email warning you to stop spending or transfer money.</p>

                <h3>Keep a Buffer</h3>
                <p>Always maintain a cushion of $50-100 in your account. Treat this amount as $0 in your mind. This buffer protects against small miscalculations or forgotten transactions.</p>

                <p>Using a <a href="../../calculators/budget.html">budget calculator</a> helps you plan your spending and ensure you always have enough money in your account.</p>

                <h3>Link Your Savings Account</h3>
                <p>Set up overdraft protection by linking your savings account. A $10 transfer fee is better than a $35 overdraft fee. Just make sure you actually have money in savings.</p>

                <h3>Opt Out of Overdraft Coverage</h3>
                <p>Contact your bank and opt out of overdraft coverage for debit card and ATM transactions. Your card will simply be declined if you don't have enough money - no fee charged. This only affects debit purchases and ATM withdrawals, not checks or automatic payments.</p>

                <h3>Use Alerts and Reminders</h3>
                <p>Set calendar reminders for when automatic payments are due. Review your subscriptions monthly to remember what's being charged to your account.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You Overdraft</h2>
                <p>If you do overdraft your account, take immediate action to minimize damage:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Deposit money immediately:</strong> Cover the negative balance as soon as possible to stop extended overdraft fees</li>
                    <li><strong>Call your bank:</strong> If this is your first overdraft or a rare occurrence, politely ask if they'll waive the fee. Many banks will waive one or two fees per year</li>
                    <li><strong>Review what happened:</strong> Figure out why you overdrafted to prevent it from happening again</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjust your habits:</strong> Set up alerts, start tracking your balance, or reduce spending</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Long-Term Impact of Frequent Overdrafts</h2>
                <p>Repeatedly overdrafting your account has consequences beyond just the fees:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your bank may close your account if overdrafts are frequent</li>
                    <li>Closed accounts get reported to ChexSystems, making it hard to open accounts at other banks</li>
                    <li>You waste hundreds of dollars per year on avoidable fees</li>
                    <li>It indicates poor money management, which can affect financial opportunities</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Managing your <a href="../finance-basics/what-is-cash-flow.html">cash flow</a> carefully prevents these issues and keeps your banking relationship healthy.</p>
