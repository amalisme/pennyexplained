                <p class="lead">Overdraft happens when you spend more money than you have in your bank account. When this occurs, your account balance goes negative, and the bank typically charges you a fee for covering the shortage.</p>

                <p>Understanding overdrafts helps you avoid costly fees and manage your money more effectively. A single overdraft can cost $35, and multiple overdrafts in one day can add up to hundreds of dollars in fees.</p>

                <h2>How Overdraft Works</h2>

                <p>When you overdraw your account, the bank has a decision to make. They can either decline the transaction (your card gets rejected) or cover the transaction and charge you a fee.</p>

                <p>Here's a simple example: You have $50 in your checking account. You buy groceries for $75. If the bank covers this transaction, you're now overdrawn by $25. Your new balance is -$25, and the bank charges you an overdraft fee of $35. Your actual balance becomes -$60.</p>

                <p>Now you owe the bank $60 before your account returns to positive territory. Until you deposit money, every additional purchase could trigger another $35 fee.</p>

                <h2>What Triggers an Overdraft</h2>

                <p>Overdrafts can happen in several ways. The most common is swiping your debit card when you don't have enough money. For instance, if you have $30 and try to spend $50, the transaction might go through but trigger an overdraft.</p>

                <p>Automatic payments can also cause overdrafts. If your phone bill of $85 auto-pays but you only have $60 in your account, you'll be overdrawn and charged a fee.</p>

                <p>Written checks can overdraw your account too. If you write a check for $200 but only have $150, when the check is deposited and processed, you'll go into overdraft.</p>

                <p>ATM withdrawals are another trigger. Some ATMs won't warn you that you're overdrawing—they'll dispense the cash and you'll discover the overdraft fee later.</p>

                <h2>Overdraft Fees Explained</h2>

                <p>Most banks charge $30 to $35 per overdraft transaction. This fee is charged each time a transaction overdraws your account, not just once per day.</p>

                <p>Here's what multiple overdrafts look like: You have $60 in your account on Monday morning. Throughout the day, you make these purchases:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Coffee: $6 (balance: $54)</li>
                    <li>Gas: $45 (balance: $9)</li>
                    <li>Lunch: $15 (overdraft #1, balance: -$6, fee: $35, new balance: -$41)</li>
                    <li>Groceries: $50 (overdraft #2, balance: -$91, fee: $35, new balance: -$126)</li>
                    <li>Dinner: $25 (overdraft #3, balance: -$151, fee: $35, new balance: -$186)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In one day, you've racked up $105 in overdraft fees on top of being $51 in the negative for actual purchases. You'd need to deposit at least $186 just to get back to zero.</p>

                <h2>Extended Overdraft Fees</h2>

                <p>Some banks charge additional fees if your account stays negative for several days. This is called an extended overdraft fee or continuous overdraft fee.</p>

                <p>For example, your account might incur a $5 to $10 fee for every day it remains negative past three or five days. If your account stays overdrawn for a week and the bank charges $7 per day after day three, you'd pay $28 in extended fees plus the original overdraft fees.</p>

                <h2>Overdraft Protection Options</h2>

                <p>Many banks offer overdraft protection services that can help you avoid or reduce overdraft fees. One common option is linking your checking account to a savings account. When you overdraw checking, money automatically transfers from savings to cover it.</p>

                <p>For example, you have $40 in checking and $500 in savings. You buy something for $60. The bank takes $20 from your savings to cover the shortage. You might pay a small transfer fee (like $10), but that's much less than the $35 overdraft fee.</p>

                <p>Another option is linking to a credit card. If you overdraw, the bank charges your credit card for the difference. This turns the overdraft into a credit card charge, which means you'll pay credit card interest if you don't pay it off quickly, but you avoid the overdraft fee.</p>

                <p>Some banks offer a line of credit specifically for overdraft protection. This works like a small loan that kicks in when you overdraw, with interest charges but no overdraft fees.</p>

                <h3>Opting Out of Overdraft Coverage</h3>

                <p>You can opt out of overdraft coverage entirely. When you do this, your debit card transactions will simply decline if you don't have enough money. Your card gets rejected at the register, which might be embarrassing, but you won't pay any fees.</p>

                <p>This option doesn't prevent all overdrafts though. Checks and automatic payments can still cause your account to go negative even if you've opted out of debit card overdraft coverage.</p>

                <h2>How Banks Process Transactions</h2>

                <p>The order in which banks process transactions can affect whether you overdraw. Some banks process the largest transactions first, which can lead to more overdraft fees.</p>

                <p>Here's an example: You have $100 in your account and make these transactions on Monday:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>$10 purchase</li>
                    <li>$15 purchase</li>
                    <li>$20 purchase</li>
                    <li>$90 purchase</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If the bank processes smallest to largest: The $10, $15, and $20 go through fine (balance now $55), but the $90 causes one overdraft. Total fees: $35.</p>

                <p>If the bank processes largest to smallest: The $90 processes first (balance now $10), then the $20 causes an overdraft, then the $15 causes another, then the $10 causes another. Total fees: $105.</p>

                <p>Most banks now process transactions in the order they occur, but it's worth understanding how your specific bank handles this.</p>

                <h2>Avoiding Overdrafts</h2>

                <p>The most reliable way to avoid overdrafts is keeping track of your balance. Check your account regularly through online banking or the mobile app. Know how much money you have before making purchases.</p>

                <p>Many banks offer low balance alerts. You can set up a text or email notification when your balance drops below a certain amount, like $100 or $50. This gives you a warning before you accidentally overdraw.</p>

                <p>Building a small buffer in your checking account helps too. If you keep an extra $100 or $200 beyond what you think you need, you have cushion for unexpected expenses or forgotten automatic payments.</p>

                <p>Linking accounts for overdraft protection is another strategy. Even though there might be a small transfer fee, it's much cheaper than a full overdraft fee.</p>

                <h2>What to Do If You Overdraw</h2>

                <p>If you do overdraw your account, deposit money as soon as possible. The longer your account stays negative, the more fees you might accumulate. Even if you can't cover the full amount immediately, depositing what you can helps minimize extended overdraft fees.</p>

                <p>You can also call your bank and explain the situation. If it's your first time, they might waive the fee as a courtesy. Banks aren't required to do this, but many will for customers with good account history.</p>

                <h2>Overdraft vs NSF Fee</h2>

                <p>Overdraft fees and NSF (non-sufficient funds) fees are similar but different. An overdraft fee occurs when the bank covers a transaction you can't afford—the payment goes through and you owe the bank. An NSF fee occurs when the bank declines the transaction because you don't have enough money.</p>

                <p>Both fees typically cost the same ($30-$35), but with overdraft, the payment completes and with NSF, it doesn't. With NSF, you might also face a late payment fee from whoever you were trying to pay.</p>

                <h2>Overdraft Laws and Regulations</h2>

                <p>Federal law requires banks to get your permission before enrolling you in overdraft coverage for debit card and ATM transactions. When you open an account, they must ask if you want this coverage.</p>

                <p>However, checks and automatic payments can still overdraw your account even if you decline debit card overdraft coverage. The opt-in requirement only applies to ATM withdrawals and one-time debit card purchases.</p>
