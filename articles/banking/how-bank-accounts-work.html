                <p>Bank accounts work through a system of deposits, withdrawals, and electronic record-keeping. The bank doesn't literally store your cash in a vault with your name on it. Instead, they track your balance electronically and use your money to make loans to others. Understanding how <a href="what-is-bank-account.html">bank accounts</a> function helps you manage your money more effectively.</p>

                <h2>The Deposit Process</h2>
                <p>When you deposit money into your bank account, here's what happens step by step:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You provide money:</strong> Cash, check, or electronic transfer</li>
                    <li><strong>Bank records it:</strong> They add the amount to your account balance</li>
                    <li><strong>Money goes into reserves:</strong> Your physical cash joins the bank's reserves</li>
                    <li><strong>You can access it:</strong> The balance is available for withdrawal or spending</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You deposit a $1,000 paycheck. The bank credits your account $1,000. The check gets processed through the banking system. Within 1-2 business days, the funds are fully available.</p>

                <p>For direct deposits from your employer, the money transfers electronically between banks. This is faster than depositing a physical check and often makes funds available on the same day.</p>

                <h2>The Withdrawal Process</h2>
                <p>When you withdraw money, the bank follows a specific process to ensure you have sufficient funds:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You request money:</strong> At ATM, teller, or through debit card purchase</li>
                    <li><strong>Bank checks balance:</strong> Ensures you have enough money</li>
                    <li><strong>Bank debits account:</strong> Subtracts amount from your balance</li>
                    <li><strong>You receive money:</strong> Cash from ATM, or merchant gets paid</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have $500 in your account and buy groceries for $75 with your debit card. The store's system contacts your bank, your bank confirms you have $500, approves the transaction, and immediately reduces your balance to $425.</p>

                <p>If you try to spend more than you have, the transaction might be declined, or you could face an <a href="what-is-overdraft.html">overdraft</a> if your account has overdraft protection enabled.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Understanding Your Balance</h2>
                <p>Your account balance is the current amount of money in your account, but there are actually two types of balances you should know about:</p>

                <h3>Available Balance</h3>
                <p>This is the money you can actually spend right now. It accounts for pending transactions that haven't fully processed yet.</p>

                <h3>Current Balance</h3>
                <p>This shows all money in your account, including pending deposits and withdrawals. It might be higher or lower than your available balance.</p>

                <h3>Pending Transactions</h3>
                <p>These are purchases or deposits that the bank knows about but hasn't finished processing. They typically take 1-3 business days to complete.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your current balance is $1,000. You wrote a check for $200 that hasn't cleared yet. Your current balance still shows $1,000, but your available balance is $800 because the bank is holding $200 for that check.</p>

                <h2>How Banks Use Your Money</h2>
                <p>Banks don't keep all deposited money sitting in a vault. Instead, they operate on something called fractional reserve banking:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep some as reserves:</strong> Banks must keep a percentage (typically 10%) of deposits on hand</li>
                    <li><strong>Loan out the rest:</strong> The remaining money is loaned to other customers</li>
                    <li><strong>Charge interest on loans:</strong> People borrowing pay interest rates of 5-20%</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay you interest:</strong> You earn a small percentage on savings (often 0.5-5%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep the difference:</strong> The bank profits from the gap between what they charge and what they pay</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You deposit $1,000 in a savings account earning 2% interest. The bank keeps $100 as reserves and loans out $900 to someone buying a car at 8% interest. They pay you $20 per year, earn $72 from the loan, and profit $52.</p>

                <p>This system works because not everyone withdraws their money at once. Banks can loan out most deposits while still having enough cash for daily withdrawals.</p>

                <h2>Different Types of Transactions</h2>
                
                <h3>Electronic Transfers</h3>
                <p>Money moves between accounts through electronic systems like ACH (Automated Clearing House). These usually take 1-3 business days and include direct deposits, bill payments, and bank transfers.</p>

                <h3>Debit Card Purchases</h3>
                <p>When you swipe your debit card, the transaction processes in real-time or within minutes. The money is immediately deducted from your available balance.</p>

                <h3>Check Deposits</h3>
                <p>Physical checks take longer to process because banks need to verify funds from the check writer's bank. This can take 1-5 business days depending on the check amount and your account history.</p>

                <h3>Wire Transfers</h3>
                <p>These are immediate, same-day transfers typically used for large amounts. They're faster than electronic transfers but usually come with fees of $15-50.</p>

                <h2>Account Security and Protection</h2>
                <p>Your money in a bank account is protected in several ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FDIC Insurance:</strong> Protects up to $250,000 per depositor per bank</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Online banking uses secure, encrypted connections</li>
                    <li><strong>Fraud monitoring:</strong> Banks watch for suspicious activity</li>
                    <li><strong>Two-factor authentication:</strong> Extra security for online access</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Even if your bank fails, <a href="how-fdic-insurance-works.html">FDIC insurance</a> ensures you get your money back up to the coverage limit. This makes bank accounts much safer than keeping large amounts of cash at home.</p>

                <h2>The Role of Technology</h2>
                <p>Modern banking relies heavily on technology:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-time updates:</strong> Your balance updates instantly with most transactions</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile banking:</strong> Check balances, deposit checks, and transfer money from your phone</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated payments:</strong> Set up recurring bills to pay automatically</li>
                    <li><strong>Alerts and notifications:</strong> Get notified of low balances or large purchases</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These tools make it easier to manage your money and track your spending, which is essential for maintaining a healthy <a href="../finance-basics/what-is-cash-flow.html">cash flow</a>.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters for You</h2>
                <p>Understanding how bank accounts work helps you:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid overdraft fees by knowing when transactions actually process</li>

                </ul>
