                <p class="lead">Bank accounts work by keeping a digital record of your money. When you deposit funds, the bank adds that amount to your account balance. When you withdraw or spend money, they subtract it. The bank tracks every transaction and keeps your money safe.</p>

                <p>Understanding how bank accounts work helps you manage your money better and avoid common mistakes like overdrafts or unexpected fees.</p>

                <h2>Opening a Bank Account</h2>

                <p>When you open a bank account, the bank creates a unique account number just for you. This number identifies your specific account in the bank's system. You'll also receive a routing number, which identifies the bank itself.</p>

                <p>The bank requires basic information like your name, address, Social Security number, and a form of ID. Most banks also ask for an initial deposit—this might be $25, $50, or $100 depending on the account type.</p>

                <p>Once your account is open, the bank gives you access through several methods: online banking on their website, a mobile app for your phone, ATM access with a card and PIN, and sometimes a physical debit card for purchases.</p>

                <h2>Making Deposits</h2>

                <p>Deposits add money to your account balance. There are several ways to deposit money, and each one works a bit differently.</p>

                <p>Direct deposit is when money goes straight from your employer to your account. For example, if you earn $2,000 biweekly, your employer sends that amount electronically to your bank on payday. The money usually appears in your account on the same day or the next business day.</p>

                <p>You can also deposit cash or checks in person at a bank branch. The teller takes your deposit, scans or processes it, and updates your account immediately for cash or within 1-2 business days for checks.</p>

                <p>Mobile deposit lets you deposit checks using your phone. You photograph the front and back of the check through the bank's app. The bank processes it digitally, and the funds typically become available within 1-2 business days.</p>

                <h2>Making Withdrawals</h2>

                <p>Withdrawals take money out of your account. The most common way is using your debit card at an ATM. You insert your card, enter your PIN, and select how much cash you want (like $40, $60, or $100). The ATM dispenses the cash and your account balance decreases by that amount.</p>

                <p>You can also withdraw money in person at a bank branch. You tell the teller how much you need, they verify your identity, and give you cash from your account.</p>

                <p>When you use your debit card to make purchases, that's also a withdrawal. If you buy $75 worth of groceries with your debit card, your account balance goes down by $75.</p>

                <h2>How Your Balance Works</h2>

                <p>Your account balance is the total amount of money in your account at any given time. It changes throughout the day as transactions process.</p>

                <p>Here's a simple example of how a balance changes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Monday morning: $800 balance</li>
                    <li>Monday afternoon: Paycheck of $1,500 deposits (new balance: $2,300)</li>
                    <li>Tuesday: Rent payment of $1,000 processes (new balance: $1,300)</li>
                    <li>Wednesday: Grocery purchase of $120 (new balance: $1,180)</li>
                    <li>Thursday: Gas purchase of $45 (new balance: $1,135)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some banks show two types of balances: your "current balance" (what's actually in your account right now) and your "available balance" (what you can actually spend after accounting for pending transactions). These can be different if you have pending deposits or purchases that haven't fully processed yet.</p>

                <h2>How Transactions Process</h2>

                <p>Not all transactions happen instantly. When you swipe your debit card at a store, the transaction usually shows as "pending" for 1-3 business days before it fully processes.</p>

                <p>During this pending period, the money is essentially reserved. You can see it listed in your transaction history, and it's subtracted from your available balance, but it hasn't officially left your account yet.</p>

                <p>For example, if you have $500 and make a $100 purchase on Monday, your current balance might still show $500 on Tuesday morning, but your available balance shows $400 because the $100 is pending.</p>

                <h2>Account Statements</h2>

                <p>Every month, your bank provides a statement listing all account activity. This includes your starting balance, every deposit and withdrawal, any fees charged, and your ending balance.</p>

                <p>A typical monthly statement might look like this:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Beginning balance (October 1): $750</li>
                    <li>Deposits: $2,400 (two paychecks)</li>
                    <li>Withdrawals: $2,280 (rent, groceries, bills, purchases)</li>
                    <li>Fees: $0</li>
                    <li>Ending balance (October 31): $870</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Reviewing your statement regularly helps you track spending, spot errors, and notice any unauthorized transactions quickly.</p>

                <h2>Online and Mobile Banking</h2>

                <p>Most banks now offer online banking through their website and a mobile app. These tools let you check your balance anytime, view recent transactions, transfer money between accounts, and pay bills.</p>

                <p>When you log into online banking, you see your current balance and a list of recent activity. You can click on any transaction to see more details like the exact merchant name, date, and amount.</p>

                <p>Many apps now offer instant notifications. You can set up alerts for low balances (like "notify me if my balance drops below $100"), large purchases (like "alert me for any charge over $500"), or deposits (like "let me know when my paycheck arrives").</p>

                <h2>Security Features</h2>

                <p>Banks use multiple security measures to protect your account. Your account requires a password or PIN that only you know. Many banks now use two-factor authentication, requiring both your password and a code sent to your phone.</p>

                <p>Banks monitor accounts for suspicious activity. If someone tries to use your debit card in another country or makes an unusual purchase, the bank might freeze the transaction and contact you to verify it's legitimate.</p>

                <p>Your deposits are also protected by FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per person, per bank. This means even if the bank fails, your money is safe.</p>

                <h2>How Interest Works (For Savings)</h2>

                <p>Some accounts, particularly savings accounts, pay interest. This is money the bank pays you for keeping your funds with them. Interest is calculated as a percentage of your balance.</p>

                <p>For example, if you have $5,000 in a savings account with 4% annual interest, here's how it works:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Annual interest: $5,000 × 0.04 = $200</li>
                    <li>Monthly interest: $200 ÷ 12 = about $16.67 per month</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The bank usually pays this interest monthly. It gets added to your balance automatically, so you earn interest on your interest (compound interest).</p>

                <h2>Common Account Activities</h2>

                <p>Bank accounts handle various types of transactions daily. Automatic payments (like rent or utilities) withdraw money on scheduled dates without you needing to do anything.</p>

                <p>Transfers between your own accounts (like moving $200 from checking to savings) usually happen instantly. Transfers to other people might take 1-3 business days depending on the method.</p>

                <p>Check deposits used to take several days to clear, but many banks now make funds available faster—sometimes the same day for regular customers or within 1-2 business days for others.</p>

                <h2>What Happens Behind the Scenes</h2>

                <p>When you make a deposit, the bank doesn't physically store your exact cash in a vault with your name on it. Instead, they keep track of how much you have in their computer system.</p>

                <p>The bank uses most of the money customers deposit to make loans to other people (mortgages, car loans, etc.). They keep enough cash on hand to cover normal daily withdrawals from all customers.</p>

                <p>This system works because not everyone withdraws their money at once. The bank pays you interest (in savings accounts) using a portion of the profit they make from loans.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
