                <p>The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) is a government agency that insures <a href="what-is-bank-account.html">bank deposits</a> up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank. This means if your bank fails, you're guaranteed to get your money back up to this limit, making your deposits far safer than keeping cash at home.</p>

                <h2>What FDIC Insurance Covers</h2>
                <p>FDIC insurance protects the money you deposit in FDIC-insured banks. Here's what's covered:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Checking accounts:</strong> All money in your checking account up to $250,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Savings accounts:</strong> Including high-yield savings and money market accounts</li>
                    <li><strong>Certificates of Deposit (CDs):</strong> Even if they haven't matured yet</li>
                    <li><strong>Cashier's checks and money orders:</strong> Issued by the bank</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have $100,000 in a <a href="checking-vs-savings-account.html">savings account</a>, $50,000 in a checking account, and $75,000 in a CD at the same bank. That's $225,000 total, which is fully covered by FDIC insurance.</p>

                <h2>What FDIC Insurance Doesn't Cover</h2>
                <p>It's important to know what FDIC insurance does not protect:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stock investments:</strong> Money invested in stocks or ETFs</li>
                    <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Government or corporate bonds</li>
                    <li><strong>Mutual funds:</strong> Even if bought through your bank</li>
                    <li><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital currencies</li>
                    <li><strong>Safe deposit box contents:</strong> Jewelry, documents, or valuables stored in boxes</li>
                    <li><strong>Losses from theft or fraud:</strong> Stolen money from your account (though banks often have other protections for this)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> FDIC insurance only covers deposit accounts at FDIC-insured banks. Credit unions have similar protection through NCUA (National Credit Union Administration) insurance.</p>

                    <div class="ad-placeholder ad-rectangle">Advertisement - Rectangle (300x250)</div>
                </div>

                <h2>The $250,000 Coverage Limit</h2>
                <p>The $250,000 limit applies per depositor, per bank, per account ownership category. This means you can actually have more than $250,000 insured at one bank if you structure your accounts correctly.</p>

                <h3>Single Accounts</h3>
                <p>If you're the only owner of the account, you're covered up to $250,000 total across all your single accounts at that bank.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have $150,000 in savings and $100,000 in checking at the same bank, both in your name only. Your total is $250,000, which is fully insured.</p>

                <h3>Joint Accounts</h3>
                <p>Joint accounts (owned by two or more people) get $250,000 of coverage per co-owner.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You and your spouse have a joint checking account with $500,000. Each of you is covered for $250,000, so the entire $500,000 is insured.</p>

                <h3>Different Account Categories</h3>
                <p>You can multiply your coverage by using different ownership categories at the same bank:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Individual account: $250,000</li>
                    <li>Joint account with spouse: $500,000 ($250,000 each)</li>
                    <li>Retirement account (IRA): $250,000</li>
                    <li>Trust account: $250,000 per beneficiary</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> At one bank, you have $250,000 in your personal savings, $500,000 in a joint account with your spouse, and $250,000 in an IRA. All $1,000,000 is fully insured because it's in different ownership categories.</p>

                <h2>How FDIC Insurance Protects You When a Bank Fails</h2>
                <p>When a bank fails, the FDIC steps in quickly to protect depositors. Here's what typically happens:</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Bank Closes</h3>
                <p>A federal or state regulator closes the failed bank, usually on a Friday after business hours to minimize disruption.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: FDIC Takes Over</h3>
                <p>The FDIC becomes the receiver, taking control of the bank's assets and customer accounts.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Your Accounts Are Protected</h3>
                <p>The FDIC typically handles failed banks in one of two ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Another bank takes over:</strong> Most common. Another healthy bank buys the failed bank. Your accounts automatically transfer to the new bank, often by Monday morning. You keep the same account numbers and have immediate access to your money.</li>
                    <li><strong>FDIC pays directly:</strong> If no bank wants to buy it, the FDIC sends you a check for your insured deposits, typically within a few business days.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your bank fails on Friday. Over the weekend, the FDIC arranges for a larger bank to take over. On Monday, you receive a letter saying your accounts are now with the new bank. Your $50,000 balance remains the same, and your debit card still works.</p>

                <h2>How to Know If Your Bank Is FDIC Insured</h2>
                <p>Most major banks are FDIC insured, but you should always verify:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Look for the FDIC logo:</strong> Banks display it in branches and on websites</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask a bank employee:</strong> They can confirm FDIC membership</li>
                    <li><strong>Check online:</strong> Visit the FDIC's BankFind tool at fdic.gov</li>
                    <li><strong>Read account documents:</strong> FDIC insurance is mentioned in account opening materials</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Both traditional banks and <a href="online-banks-vs-traditional-banks.html">online banks</a> can be FDIC insured. Online-only banks often have FDIC insurance through partner banks.</p>

                <h2>History and Purpose of FDIC</h2>
                <p>The FDIC was created in 1933 during the Great Depression after thousands of banks failed and people lost their savings. Before FDIC insurance, bank failures meant ordinary people lost everything they had deposited.</p>

                <p>Since the FDIC was established, no depositor has lost a single penny of FDIC-insured funds. This track record has maintained confidence in the U.S. banking system for over 90 years.</p>

                <h2>What About Amounts Over $250,000?</h2>
                <p>If you have more than $250,000 to deposit, you have several options to stay fully insured:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Open accounts at different banks:</strong> Each bank provides separate $250,000 coverage</li>
                    <li><strong>Use different ownership categories:</strong> Individual, joint, retirement, trust accounts at the same bank</li>
                    <li><strong>Add beneficiaries:</strong> Certain account types multiply coverage by number of beneficiaries</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider CDARS or ICS programs:</strong> Some banks offer programs that spread large deposits across multiple banks to maximize FDIC coverage</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have $600,000 to deposit. You put $250,000 in Bank A, $250,000 in Bank B, and $100,000 in Bank C. All $600,000 is fully insured.</p>

                <h2>Why FDIC Insurance Matters for Your Financial Security</h2>
                <p>FDIC insurance provides several important benefits:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> You don't have to worry about your bank's financial health</li>
                    <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Prevents bank runs where everyone tries to withdraw at once</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> You can focus on growing your <a href="../saving/what-is-emergency-fund.html">emergency fund</a> without fear</li>
                    <li><strong>No cost to you:</strong> Banks pay for FDIC insurance, not depositors</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This protection is one reason why keeping money in a bank is much safer than hiding cash at home, where it could be stolen, lost in a fire, or destroyed.</p>
