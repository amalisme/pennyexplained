                <p class="lead">FDIC insurance is a government program that protects your money if your bank fails. It covers up to $250,000 per person, per bank, and you don't pay anything for this protection—it's automatic when you open an account at an FDIC-insured bank.</p>

                <p>Understanding FDIC insurance helps you know your money is safe and plan how to protect amounts over $250,000 if you have them.</p>

                <h2>What Is the FDIC?</h2>

                <p>The FDIC stands for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It's a U.S. government agency created in 1933 during the Great Depression, when thousands of banks failed and people lost their life savings.</p>

                <p>The FDIC's main job is to protect people's deposits when banks fail. If an FDIC-insured bank closes, the FDIC makes sure depositors get their money back, up to the coverage limits.</p>

                <p>The FDIC is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. Since its creation, no depositor has lost a penny of FDIC-insured funds.</p>

                <h2>How Much Coverage You Get</h2>

                <p>FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. This might sound complicated, but here's what it means in practice.</p>

                <p>If you have $200,000 in a savings account at Bank A, it's fully covered. If your bank fails, you get all $200,000 back. If you have $300,000 in a checking account at Bank A, only $250,000 is covered. You'd lose $50,000 if the bank failed.</p>

                <p>However, the coverage applies separately to different banks. If you have $200,000 at Bank A and $200,000 at Bank B, both amounts are fully covered because they're at different institutions.</p>

                <h2>Account Ownership Categories</h2>

                <p>FDIC insurance treats different types of accounts separately. The main categories are single accounts (owned by one person), joint accounts (owned by two or more people), retirement accounts (like IRAs), and trust accounts.</p>

                <p>Each category gets separate coverage. Here's how this works with real numbers:</p>

                <p>Sarah has these accounts at the same bank:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individual savings account: $250,000 (fully covered)</li>
                    <li>Joint checking with her spouse: $500,000 (fully covered—$250,000 per person)</li>
                    <li>IRA retirement account: $250,000 (fully covered)</li>
                    <li>Total at one bank: $1,000,000, all fully insured</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Even though she has $1 million at one bank, it's all protected because it's spread across different ownership categories.</p>

                <h2>Single Accounts</h2>

                <p>A single account is owned by one person. All your individual accounts at one bank are added together for insurance purposes.</p>

                <p>For example, if you have $150,000 in checking, $80,000 in savings, and $50,000 in a money market account at the same bank, these total $280,000. Since the limit is $250,000, you'd have $30,000 uninsured.</p>

                <h2>Joint Accounts</h2>

                <p>Joint accounts owned by two or more people receive up to $250,000 of coverage per co-owner. A joint account with two people can hold up to $500,000 and be fully insured ($250,000 per person).</p>

                <p>For example, if you and your spouse have a joint account with $400,000, it's fully covered. Each of you is insured for $200,000 of that balance.</p>

                <h2>What FDIC Insurance Covers</h2>

                <p>FDIC insurance covers deposits in checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). It also covers cashier's checks, money orders, and other official items issued by the bank.</p>

                <p>When a bank fails, the FDIC typically pays you back very quickly. Most people get access to their insured deposits within a few business days, either by check or by having their account transferred to another bank.</p>

                <h2>What FDIC Insurance Doesn't Cover</h2>

                <p>FDIC insurance only covers deposits. It doesn't cover investments like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, crypto assets, annuities, or life insurance policies, even if you bought them through your bank.</p>

                <p>It also doesn't cover losses from theft, fraud (in most cases), or safe deposit box contents. If someone steals money from your account through fraud, that's a different issue handled by the bank's fraud protection policies, not FDIC insurance.</p>

                <h2>How Banks Get FDIC Insurance</h2>

                <p>Banks pay premiums to the FDIC to insure their customers' deposits. You don't pay for this coverage—it's free to you as a depositor. The bank pays the cost, similar to how they pay for building maintenance or security systems.</p>

                <p>The FDIC maintains a fund (the Deposit Insurance Fund) using these premiums. When a bank fails, the FDIC uses this fund to pay back depositors.</p>

                <h2>Checking If Your Bank Is Insured</h2>

                <p>Most banks display the FDIC logo on their website, in their branches, and on account documents. However, not all financial institutions are FDIC-insured.</p>

                <p>To verify your bank is insured, visit the FDIC's website at fdic.gov and use their BankFind tool. You can search by bank name or web address. The tool shows if the bank is FDIC-insured and provides the official insurance certificate number.</p>

                <p>Credit unions have similar insurance through the NCUA (National Credit Union Administration), which works the same way with the same $250,000 limit.</p>

                <h2>What Happens When a Bank Fails</h2>

                <p>Bank failures are rare, but they do happen. When a bank fails, the FDIC typically steps in on a Friday after the bank closes. By Monday morning, one of two things usually happens.</p>

                <p>Most commonly, the FDIC arranges for another bank to take over the failed bank. Your account transfers to the new bank automatically. You might get a new debit card and new account number, but your money is there and accessible.</p>

                <p>Less commonly, the FDIC pays depositors directly. You receive a check for your insured deposits, typically within a few business days. For amounts over $250,000, you become a creditor of the failed bank and might recover additional funds as the bank's assets are sold, though this isn't guaranteed.</p>

                <h2>Protecting Amounts Over $250,000</h2>

                <p>If you have more than $250,000 to protect, you have several options. The simplest is spreading money across multiple banks. With $600,000, you could keep $250,000 at Bank A, $250,000 at Bank B, and $100,000 at Bank C.</p>

                <p>Another option is using different account ownership categories at the same bank, as shown earlier with single accounts, joint accounts, and retirement accounts.</p>

                <p>Some people use a service called CDARS (Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service) or ICS (Insured Cash Sweep), where your money is automatically distributed across multiple banks to stay under the $250,000 limit at each one, while you still work with just one bank.</p>

                <h2>FDIC Coverage Examples</h2>

                <p>Let's look at different scenarios to see how coverage works:</p>

                <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> John has $180,000 in checking and $90,000 in savings at Bank X. Total: $270,000. Coverage: $250,000. Uninsured: $20,000.</p>

                <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Maria has $150,000 at Bank Y and $150,000 at Bank Z. Total: $300,000. Coverage: All $300,000 (different banks).</p>

                <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Alex and Sam have a joint account with $450,000 at Bank Q. Coverage: All $450,000 ($225,000 per person, both under the $250,000 limit).</p>

                <p><strong>Example 4:</strong> Chris has $200,000 in individual savings and $200,000 in an IRA at Bank R. Total: $400,000. Coverage: All $400,000 (different ownership categories).</p>

                <h2>Interest and FDIC Insurance</h2>

                <p>FDIC insurance covers both your principal (the money you deposited) and any interest earned up to the day the bank fails. If you had $248,000 in savings earning interest, and the bank failed when your balance had grown to $251,000, you'd be covered for $250,000 and lose $1,000.</p>

                <h2>Online Banks and FDIC Insurance</h2>

                <p>Online banks that are FDIC-insured offer the exact same protection as traditional banks with branches. The insurance doesn't depend on whether the bank has physical locations.</p>

                <p>Before opening an account with any online bank, verify they're FDIC-insured using the BankFind tool. Some online-only financial companies are not banks and don't have FDIC insurance, so this verification is important.</p>

                <h2>FDIC vs NCUA vs SIPC</h2>

                <p>FDIC insures bank deposits. NCUA (National Credit Union Administration) insures credit union deposits the same way. SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation) protects brokerage accounts, but it works differently—it protects securities and cash up to $500,000 if a brokerage firm fails, but doesn't protect against investment losses.</p>
