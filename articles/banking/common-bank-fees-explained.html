                <p>Understanding common <a href="what-is-bank-fee.html">bank fees</a> helps you choose the right bank and avoid unnecessary charges. Most fees are avoidable once you know what triggers them and how to work around these requirements.</p>

                <h2>Monthly Maintenance Fees</h2>
                <p>Many banks charge $5-15 per month simply for having an account open. This fee covers the cost of maintaining your account and providing customer service.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Most banks waive this fee if you meet certain requirements like maintaining a minimum daily balance (typically $500-1,500), setting up direct deposit for your paycheck, or being a student under 25.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your bank charges $12 per month but waives it with a $1,500 minimum balance. If you can keep that balance, you save $144 per year.</p>

                <h2>Overdraft Fees</h2>
                <p>When you spend more money than you have in your <a href="checking-vs-savings-account.html">checking account</a>, banks charge $25-35 per transaction. This can add up quickly if multiple transactions go through on the same day.</p>

                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Track your spending carefully, set up low balance alerts on your mobile banking app, or link your savings account for overdraft protection. Some banks also offer grace periods if you deposit money by the end of the day.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have $50 in your account and buy coffee ($5), lunch ($12), and groceries ($45). All three transactions overdraw your account. You could be charged $35 × 3 = $105 in fees on top of the $62 you spent.</p>

                <h2>ATM Fees</h2>
                <p>Using an out-of-network ATM typically costs $2-3 from the ATM owner, plus another $2-3 from your own bank. That's $4-6 total just to access your own money.</p>

                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Use your bank's ATMs, get cash back when making purchases at stores, or choose a bank with a large ATM network or one that reimburses ATM fees.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using an out-of-network ATM twice a week costs about $500 per year in fees. Using your bank's ATMs costs $0.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Insufficient Funds (NSF) Fees</h2>
                <p>Similar to overdraft fees, NSF fees ($25-35) are charged when a payment is rejected because you don't have enough money. The difference is the payment doesn't go through at all.</p>

                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Keep a buffer in your account, track all automatic payments, and review your account regularly to ensure you have enough for upcoming bills.</p>

                <h2>Wire Transfer Fees</h2>
                <p>Sending money via wire transfer can cost $15-30 domestically and $35-50 internationally. Receiving a wire might also cost $10-15.</p>

                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Use free alternatives like Zelle, Venmo, or PayPal for personal transfers. Wire transfers are best reserved for large transactions like down payments where immediate transfer is essential.</p>

                <h2>Paper Statement Fees</h2>
                <p>Some banks charge $2-5 per month to mail you paper statements instead of using online statements.</p>

                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Switch to electronic statements. They're free, easier to search, and better for the environment.</p>

                <h2>Minimum Balance Fees</h2>
                <p>Some accounts require you to keep a minimum balance (like $500 or $1,000). If you dip below it, you're charged a fee of $5-15.</p>

                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Choose an account without minimum balance requirements, or keep enough money in the account to meet the minimum. Understanding your <a href="../finance-basics/what-is-cash-flow.html">cash flow</a> helps you maintain required balances without stress.</p>

                <h2>Foreign Transaction Fees</h2>
                <p>Using your debit card in another country or making purchases in foreign currency often triggers a 3% fee on each transaction.</p>

                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Get a debit card or credit card with no foreign transaction fees if you travel internationally. Some online banks offer these for free.</p>

                <h2>Account Closure Fees</h2>
                <p>Some banks charge $25-50 if you close your account within 90-180 days of opening it. This discourages people from opening accounts just for sign-up bonuses.</p>

                <p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Keep new accounts open for at least 6 months before closing them, or ask if the fee can be waived when closing.</p>

                <h2>Tips to Minimize Bank Fees</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read the fee schedule:</strong> Every bank provides a list of all fees when you open an account</li>
                    <li><strong>Set up alerts:</strong> Get notifications for low balances, large purchases, or upcoming bill payments</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose the right account:</strong> Online banks often have fewer fees than traditional banks</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask for waivers:</strong> If you're charged a fee for the first time, call and politely ask if they'll waive it</li>
                    <li><strong>Track your spending:</strong> Use your bank's app or a <a href="../../calculators/budget.html">budget calculator</a> to stay on top of your money</li>
                </ul>
