                <p class="lead">Banks charge various fees for account maintenance, transactions, and services. Understanding these common fees helps you avoid unnecessary charges and choose the right banking options for your needs.</p>

                <p>The most common fees include monthly maintenance, overdraft, ATM, wire transfer, and returned item fees. Each serves a different purpose and can often be avoided with the right knowledge.</p>

                <h2>Monthly Maintenance Fee</h2>

                <p>A monthly maintenance fee is a recurring charge just for having an account. Banks typically charge $5 to $15 per month for checking accounts and sometimes for savings accounts.</p>

                <p>For example, a bank might charge $12 monthly for a standard checking account. Over a year, that's $144 just for having the account open.</p>

                <p>Most banks waive this fee if you meet certain requirements. Common ways to avoid it include maintaining a minimum daily balance (often $500 to $1,500), setting up direct deposit of at least $500 per month, or being under a certain age (like 25).</p>

                <p>Here's a real example: Bank of America's Core Checking charges $12 per month, but they waive it if you have direct deposits of $250 or more, maintain a $1,500 minimum daily balance, or are enrolled as a student under 24.</p>

                <h2>Overdraft Fee</h2>

                <p>An overdraft fee is charged when you spend more money than you have in your account. This typically costs $30 to $35 per transaction, and you can be charged multiple times in one day.</p>

                <p>Here's how it happens: You have $100 in your account. You buy groceries for $80 (balance: $20). Then you buy gas for $50. You don't have enough money, so the bank covers the $30 difference but charges you a $35 overdraft fee. Your new balance is -$65.</p>

                <p>If you make three transactions while overdrawn, you could pay three separate overdraft fees—potentially $105 in fees in a single day.</p>

                <p>Some banks limit how many overdraft fees they charge per day (often 3-4 fees maximum). Others charge extended overdraft fees if your account stays negative for multiple days, adding $5 to $10 per day.</p>

                <p>Ways to avoid overdraft fees include opting out of overdraft coverage (your card simply declines instead), linking a savings account to cover overdrafts, or signing up for low balance alerts that warn you before you run out of money.</p>

                <h2>Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) Fee</h2>

                <p>An NSF fee is similar to an overdraft fee but occurs when the bank declines a transaction because you don't have enough money. Even though the transaction doesn't go through, you still pay the fee—usually $30 to $35.</p>

                <p>For example, you have $50 and try to pay a $100 bill. The bank declines the payment and charges you $35. Now you have $15, the bill isn't paid, and you may also face a late fee from whoever you were trying to pay.</p>

                <h2>ATM Fees</h2>

                <p>ATM fees come in two types: fees from your bank and fees from the ATM owner. When you use an ATM outside your bank's network, you typically pay both.</p>

                <p>Your bank might charge $2 to $3 for using an out-of-network ATM. The ATM owner also charges a fee, usually $2 to $4. Together, a single withdrawal could cost you $4 to $7 in fees.</p>

                <p>If you withdraw $40 from an out-of-network ATM and pay $6 in fees, that's 15% of your withdrawal gone to fees. Withdrawing $20 could mean 30% goes to fees.</p>

                <p>To avoid ATM fees, use your bank's ATMs or those in their partner network, get cash back when making purchases at stores (usually free), or choose a bank that reimburses ATM fees.</p>

                <h2>Wire Transfer Fees</h2>

                <p>Wire transfer fees are charged when you send money electronically to another bank, especially for large amounts or international transfers. Domestic wire transfers typically cost $15 to $30, while international wires cost $35 to $50.</p>

                <p>For example, if you send $5,000 to someone using a wire transfer, your bank might charge $25 for the service. The receiving bank might also charge $10 to $15 to accept the wire.</p>

                <p>Alternatives to wire transfers include ACH transfers (usually free but slower), payment apps like Venmo or Zelle (often free for personal use), or bank-to-bank transfers through online banking (typically free).</p>

                <h2>Paper Statement Fee</h2>

                <p>Some banks charge $2 to $5 per month if you want paper statements mailed to you instead of receiving electronic statements. Over a year, that's $24 to $60 for something you can get free digitally.</p>

                <p>Most people can easily avoid this by opting for electronic statements, which are delivered to your email or available through online banking.</p>

                <h2>Minimum Balance Fee</h2>

                <p>A minimum balance fee occurs when your account balance drops below a required amount. This might be $5 to $15 charged monthly or quarterly whenever you're below the minimum.</p>

                <p>For example, if your account requires a $300 minimum balance and you drop to $250, you might be charged a $10 fee. This makes your balance even lower ($240), potentially triggering the fee again next month.</p>

                <h2>Returned Deposit Fee</h2>

                <p>If you deposit a check that bounces (meaning the check writer didn't have enough money), the bank charges you a returned deposit fee. This is typically $10 to $15.</p>

                <p>For example, someone writes you a $200 check. You deposit it and your balance increases by $200. A week later, the check bounces. The bank removes the $200 from your account and charges you a $12 fee. If you already spent that money, you could also face overdraft fees.</p>

                <h2>Stop Payment Fee</h2>

                <p>A stop payment fee is charged when you ask the bank to cancel a check you wrote. This typically costs $20 to $35 per request.</p>

                <p>You might use this if you lost a check and don't want it cashed, or if you wrote a check but the situation changed. The bank has to monitor for that specific check and prevent it from processing, which is why they charge for the service.</p>

                <h2>Account Closure Fee</h2>

                <p>Some banks charge $10 to $50 if you close your account within 90 to 180 days of opening it. This discourages people from opening accounts just for sign-up bonuses.</p>

                <p>For example, if you open an account in January and close it in March (within 90 days), you might pay a $25 early closure fee.</p>

                <h2>Foreign Transaction Fee</h2>

                <p>When you use your debit card in another country or make a purchase in foreign currency, banks often charge 1% to 3% of the transaction amount.</p>

                <p>If you spend $500 while traveling abroad, a 3% fee would cost you $15. Make several purchases and these fees add up quickly.</p>

                <p>Some banks and credit unions don't charge foreign transaction fees, which is worth considering if you travel internationally.</p>

                <h2>Excessive Withdrawal Fee</h2>

                <p>Savings accounts sometimes charge fees if you make more than six withdrawals per month. The fee is typically $5 to $15 per transaction beyond the limit.</p>

                <p>For example, if you make eight withdrawals from savings in one month, the first six are free but you pay $10 each for the seventh and eighth, totaling $20 in fees.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Fee Impact</h2>

                <p>Let's look at how fees accumulate over time. Someone with typical banking habits might pay:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Monthly maintenance fee: $12 × 12 = $144/year</li>
                    <li>Overdraft fees: 2 × $35 = $70/year</li>
                    <li>Out-of-network ATM: 8 × $5 = $40/year</li>
                    <li>Paper statements: $3 × 12 = $36/year</li>
                    <li>Total: $290/year</li>
                </ul>

                <p>That $290 could instead go into savings, cover a month's groceries, or pay for a small emergency. By switching to a fee-free bank and being mindful of account management, most of these fees are completely avoidable.</p>

                <h2>How to Check Your Fees</h2>

                <p>Your bank's fee schedule is usually available on their website under "Account Information" or "Fees." You can also request a printed copy at any branch or call customer service to ask about specific fees.</p>

                <p>Review your monthly statements to see what fees you've actually been charged. They'll be listed in your transaction history with labels like "Monthly Fee," "Overdraft Charge," or "ATM Fee."</p>
