            <p class="intro">Income is money you receive. For most people, income comes from working a job. When you get paid for your time or skills, that payment is income.</p>

            <p>Understanding income is essential to managing your money. It's the starting point for every budget and financial decision.</p>

            <h2>Common Sources of Income</h2>

            <p>Most people get income from one or more of these sources:</p>

            <h3>Employment Income</h3>
            <p>This is money you earn from a job. If you work for a company and receive a paycheck, that's employment income.</p>

            <p>For example, if you work as a teacher earning $50,000 per year, that salary is your employment income. If you work at a coffee shop earning $15 per hour, your hourly wages are employment income.</p>

            <h3>Self-Employment Income</h3>
            <p>If you work for yourself, your earnings are self-employment income. This includes freelancers, contractors, and business owners.</p>

            <p>A graphic designer who charges $500 for a logo design receives that $500 as self-employment income. A rideshare driver earning $800 in a week has $800 of self-employment income.</p>

            <h3>Other Types of Income</h3>
            <p>Income can also come from sources beyond work:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interest income:</strong> Money earned from savings accounts or bonds</li>
                <li><strong>Dividend income:</strong> Payments from stocks you own</li>
                <li><strong>Rental income:</strong> Money from renting out property</li>
                <li><strong>Government benefits:</strong> Social Security, unemployment, disability payments</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gross Income vs. Net Income</h2>

            <p>When people talk about income, they might mean two different things: gross income or net income. Understanding the difference matters.</p>

            <h3>Gross Income</h3>
            <p>Gross income is the total amount before any deductions. It's your pay before taxes, insurance, or other items are taken out.</p>

            <p>If your employer offers you a job at $60,000 per year, that's your gross annual income. If you earn $25 per hour for 40 hours, your gross weekly income is $1,000.</p>

            <h3>Net Income</h3>
            <p>Net income is what you actually receive after deductions. This is often called "take-home pay" because it's what hits your bank account.</p>

            <p>From that $60,000 gross annual income, you might pay $12,000 in taxes and $3,000 for health insurance. Your net income would be $45,000—what you actually get to use.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Gross vs. Net Income</h4>
                <p><strong>Gross Monthly Income:</strong> $5,000</p>
                <p><strong>Deductions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Federal taxes: $750</li>
                    <li>State taxes: $200</li>
                    <li>Social Security: $310</li>
                    <li>Medicare: $73</li>
                    <li>Health insurance: $200</li>
                    <li>401(k) contribution: $250</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Deductions:</strong> $1,783</p>
                <p><strong>Net Monthly Income:</strong> $3,217</p>
            </div>

            <p>When budgeting, always use your net income. That's the actual money available for expenses and savings.</p>

            <h2>How Income Is Measured</h2>

            <p>Income can be measured over different time periods. The same amount looks different depending on how you calculate it.</p>

            <h3>Annual Income</h3>
            <p>This is how much you earn in one year. Many job offers and salary discussions use annual income.</p>

            <p>If you earn $24 per hour working 40 hours per week for 52 weeks, your annual income is $49,920 before taxes.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Income</h3>
            <p>This is how much you earn in one month. Most budgets use monthly income because most bills are monthly.</p>

            <p>To convert annual income to monthly, divide by 12. An annual income of $60,000 equals $5,000 per month before taxes.</p>

            <h3>Hourly Income</h3>
            <p>Many jobs pay by the hour. Your total income depends on how many hours you work.</p>

            <p>At $18 per hour working 35 hours per week, you earn $630 per week, which is about $2,520 per month before taxes.</p>

            <h2>Regular vs. Irregular Income</h2>

            <p>Some people have the same income every pay period. Others have income that changes.</p>

            <h3>Regular Income</h3>
            <p>If you're paid a salary or work the same hours each week, your income is regular and predictable.</p>

            <p>For example, a teacher earning $55,000 per year receives the same paycheck every two weeks. This makes budgeting easier because you know exactly what's coming.</p>

            <h3>Irregular Income</h3>
            <p>Freelancers, commission-based workers, and seasonal employees often have irregular income that changes from month to month.</p>

            <p>A freelance writer might earn $4,000 one month and $1,200 the next. A retail worker might get 40 hours one week and 15 hours the next.</p>

            <p>Irregular income requires different budgeting strategies. Many people use their lowest typical month as their budget baseline and save extra from high-earning months.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Your Total Income</h2>

            <p>If you have multiple income sources, add them all up to find your total income.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Multiple Income Sources</h4>
                <p><strong>Alex's Monthly Income:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full-time job (net): $3,200</li>
                    <li>Weekend pet-sitting: $300</li>
                    <li>Selling crafts online: $150</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Monthly Income: $3,650</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Knowing your total income helps you understand what you have available for expenses, savings, and other financial goals.</p>

            <h2>Why Income Matters in Personal Finance</h2>

            <p>Income is the foundation of your personal finances. Everything else builds from there.</p>

            <p>Your income determines how much you can spend, how much you can save, and what financial goals are realistic. Someone earning $35,000 per year has different options than someone earning $100,000 per year.</p>

            <p>However, income alone doesn't determine financial success. Many people with high incomes struggle financially if their expenses are even higher. Managing what you do with your income matters just as much as how much you earn.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Your Income</h2>

            <p>Keep records of all income you receive. For employment income, save your pay stubs. For self-employment or side income, track each payment.</p>

            <p>Accurate income records help with budgeting, tax preparation, and applying for loans or apartments. You'll need to show proof of income in many situations.</p>

            <h2>Income and Taxes</h2>

            <p>Most income is taxable, meaning you owe taxes on it. Your employer typically withholds taxes from your paycheck automatically.</p>

            <p>If you have self-employment income or other income without tax withholding, you're responsible for paying taxes yourself. This is why understanding gross vs. net income matters—you need to plan for tax obligations.</p>
