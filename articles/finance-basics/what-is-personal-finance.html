            <p class="intro">Personal finance is how you manage your money. It includes earning income, paying bills, saving for goals, and making decisions about what to do with the money you have.</p>

            <p>If you've ever paid rent, bought groceries, or put money aside for something you want, you're already doing personal finance. It's not as complicated as it sounds.</p>

            <h2>The Basic Parts of Personal Finance</h2>

            <p>Personal finance has five main areas. Think of them as the building blocks of managing your money.</p>

            <h3>1. Income</h3>
            <p>Income is the money you earn. This could be from a job, freelance work, or side gigs. For most people, their paycheck is their main source of income.</p>

            <p>For example, if you earn $3,000 per month from your job, that's your income. Some people have multiple income sources, like a full-time job plus weekend babysitting.</p>

            <h3>2. Spending</h3>
            <p>Spending is what you do with your income. Every time you pay rent, buy food, or get gas for your car, you're spending money.</p>

            <p>Your spending includes both necessary expenses (like rent and groceries) and optional purchases (like eating out or streaming services). Understanding where your money goes is a key part of personal finance.</p>

            <h3>3. Saving</h3>
            <p>Saving means setting money aside for later. You might save for emergencies, a vacation, or a down payment on a car.</p>

            <p>If you earn $3,000 and spend $2,700, you could save the remaining $300. Many people try to save a portion of every paycheck, even if it's just $50 or $100.</p>

            <h3>4. Investing</h3>
            <p>Investing is putting money into things that might grow in value over time. This could include retirement accounts, stocks, or other assets.</p>

            <p>While saving keeps your money safe, investing gives it potential to grow. Most people start with saving before they move on to investing.</p>

            <h3>5. Protection</h3>
            <p>Protection means having safety nets for when things go wrong. This includes insurance (health, car, renters) and emergency savings.</p>

            <p>If your car breaks down and the repair costs $800, having savings or insurance helps you handle it without going into debt.</p>

            <h2>Why Personal Finance Matters</h2>

            <p>Managing your personal finances helps you avoid common money problems. When you understand where your money comes from and where it goes, you can make better decisions.</p>

            <p>Good personal finance habits help you pay bills on time, avoid overdraft fees, and work toward goals like moving to a nicer apartment or taking a trip.</p>

            <h3>Real Example: Monthly Personal Finance</h3>
            <p>Here's what personal finance looks like for someone named Sarah who earns $3,500 per month:</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <p><strong>Income:</strong> $3,500 from her job</p>
                <p><strong>Spending:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent: $1,200</li>
                    <li>Groceries: $400</li>
                    <li>Car payment: $300</li>
                    <li>Insurance: $150</li>
                    <li>Phone: $80</li>
                    <li>Gas: $120</li>
                    <li>Entertainment: $200</li>
                    <li>Other expenses: $250</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Spending:</strong> $2,700</p>
                <p><strong>Saving:</strong> $800 left over</p>
            </div>

            <p>Sarah puts $500 in savings and uses $300 for flexible spending. This is personal finance in action.</p>

            <h2>Common Personal Finance Activities</h2>

            <p>When you do any of these things, you're managing your personal finance:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Creating a budget to plan your spending</li>
                <li>Checking your bank account balance</li>
                <li>Deciding whether you can afford a purchase</li>
                <li>Setting up automatic bill payments</li>
                <li>Putting money in a savings account</li>
                <li>Comparing prices before buying something</li>
                <li>Tracking how much you spend each month</li>
                <li>Making a plan to pay off debt</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Personal Finance vs. Other Types of Finance</h2>

            <p>Personal finance is different from business finance or corporate finance. It's specifically about managing money as an individual or family.</p>

            <p>While a business might worry about payroll and inventory costs, personal finance focuses on your paycheck, your bills, and your savings goals.</p>

            <h2>Starting with Personal Finance</h2>

            <p>You don't need to be an expert to start managing your personal finances. Most people begin with simple steps like tracking their spending or setting a savings goal.</p>

            <p>The key is knowing where your money comes from, where it goes, and making intentional choices about both. Even small changes, like packing lunch instead of buying it, are part of personal finance.</p>
