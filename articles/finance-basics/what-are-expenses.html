            <p class="intro">Expenses are the money you spend. Every time you pay for something—whether it's rent, groceries, or a cup of coffee—you're creating an expense.</p>

            <p>Understanding your expenses is crucial for managing money. You can't control what you don't track, and tracking starts with knowing what expenses actually are.</p>

            <h2>Basic Definition</h2>

            <p>An expense is any cost you pay for goods or services. If money leaves your wallet or bank account, it's an expense.</p>

            <p>Expenses include both big things (like rent at $1,500 per month) and small things (like a $4 coffee). They're all money going out instead of staying with you.</p>

            <h2>Common Types of Expenses</h2>

            <p>Most people's expenses fall into several standard categories. Here are the most common ones:</p>

            <h3>Housing Expenses</h3>
            <p>These are costs related to where you live. They're usually your biggest monthly expense.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Rent or mortgage payment</li>
                <li>Property taxes (if you own)</li>
                <li>Home or renters insurance</li>
                <li>Utilities (electric, water, gas, trash)</li>
                <li>Internet and cable</li>
                <li>Maintenance and repairs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For example, someone might pay $1,200 rent, $150 for utilities, and $60 for internet—a total of $1,410 in monthly housing expenses.</p>

            <h3>Transportation Expenses</h3>
            <p>Costs for getting around, whether you drive, take transit, or use rideshares.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Car payment</li>
                <li>Auto insurance</li>
                <li>Gas or electric charging</li>
                <li>Car maintenance and repairs</li>
                <li>Public transportation fares</li>
                <li>Parking fees</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A typical driver might spend $350 on a car payment, $130 on insurance, $120 on gas, and $50 on maintenance—$650 total per month.</p>

            <h3>Food Expenses</h3>
            <p>Everything you spend on food and drinks, both at home and away.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Groceries</li>
                <li>Restaurants and takeout</li>
                <li>Coffee shops</li>
                <li>Delivery fees</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Someone might spend $400 on groceries and $200 eating out for a total food expense of $600 per month.</p>

            <h3>Healthcare Expenses</h3>
            <p>Medical costs, including insurance and out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Health insurance premiums</li>
                <li>Doctor visits and copays</li>
                <li>Prescription medications</li>
                <li>Dental and vision care</li>
                <li>Over-the-counter medications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Personal and Lifestyle Expenses</h3>
            <p>These vary widely based on individual choices and circumstances.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Clothing and shoes</li>
                <li>Entertainment (movies, concerts, subscriptions)</li>
                <li>Hobbies and recreation</li>
                <li>Gym memberships</li>
                <li>Personal care (haircuts, toiletries)</li>
                <li>Phone service</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Needs vs. Wants</h2>

            <p>Financial experts often divide expenses into needs and wants. This helps prioritize spending.</p>

            <h3>Need Expenses</h3>
            <p>Needs are expenses for basic requirements. You need shelter, food, basic clothing, and transportation to work.</p>

            <p>Examples of need expenses include rent, groceries, electricity, basic phone service, and car insurance. These keep your life functioning.</p>

            <h3>Want Expenses</h3>
            <p>Wants are expenses for things you'd like but don't absolutely require. They make life more enjoyable but aren't essential.</p>

            <p>Examples of want expenses include eating at restaurants, streaming services, new shoes when your current ones work fine, and concert tickets. These are nice to have but optional.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Needs vs. Wants</h4>
                <p><strong>Needs:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent: $1,100</li>
                    <li>Groceries: $350</li>
                    <li>Electric bill: $80</li>
                    <li>Car insurance: $130</li>
                    <li>Phone (basic plan): $40</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Needs: $1,700</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Wants:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eating out: $200</li>
                    <li>Streaming services: $35</li>
                    <li>Gym membership: $50</li>
                    <li>New clothes: $100</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Wants: $385</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>The line between needs and wants can blur. You need food, but you might want to eat out instead of cooking. Understanding this difference helps with budgeting decisions.</p>

            <h2>Fixed vs. Variable Expenses</h2>

            <p>Another way to categorize expenses is by whether they change from month to month.</p>

            <h3>Fixed Expenses</h3>
            <p>Fixed expenses stay the same each month. You know exactly what you'll pay.</p>

            <p>Examples include rent ($1,200 every month), car payment ($280 every month), insurance ($150 every month), and subscription services ($40 every month).</p>

            <h3>Variable Expenses</h3>
            <p>Variable expenses change from month to month. The amount differs based on your usage or choices.</p>

            <p>Examples include groceries (might be $300 one month, $450 another), gas (depends on how much you drive), utilities (higher in summer with AC), and entertainment (varies by activities).</p>

            <p>Variable expenses require more attention in budgeting because they can fluctuate significantly.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Your Expenses</h2>

            <p>To manage expenses effectively, you need to know what they are. Many people underestimate how much they actually spend.</p>

            <h3>Methods for Tracking</h3>
            <p>You can track expenses several ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Review bank and credit card statements monthly</li>
                <li>Save receipts and add them up weekly</li>
                <li>Use a phone app or spreadsheet to log each purchase</li>
                <li>Check your online banking every few days</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Pick whatever method you'll actually use consistently. The best tracking system is the one you stick with.</p>

            <h3>Expense Categories</h3>
            <p>Organizing expenses into categories makes patterns easier to see.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Monthly Expense Breakdown</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Housing: $1,350</li>
                    <li>Transportation: $420</li>
                    <li>Food: $550</li>
                    <li>Healthcare: $180</li>
                    <li>Personal/Lifestyle: $280</li>
                    <li>Savings: $300</li>
                    <li>Miscellaneous: $120</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Monthly Expenses: $3,200</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Tracking Expenses Matters</h2>

            <p>When you track expenses, you gain awareness. You might discover you spend $150 per month on coffee when you thought it was $50. Or that you're paying for three streaming services you barely use.</p>

            <p>This awareness creates opportunities. You can decide if each expense is worth it and make informed choices about where to cut back or where to spend more.</p>

            <h2>Reducing Expenses</h2>

            <p>Once you know your expenses, you might want to reduce some of them. Start with the biggest categories or the easiest wins.</p>

            <p>Someone spending $200 per month eating out might cut that to $100 by cooking more. That saves $1,200 per year. Small changes in big categories create significant savings over time.</p>

            <h2>Expenses and Your Budget</h2>

            <p>In a budget, your expenses should be less than your income. If you earn $3,500 and your expenses total $3,800, you have a problem that needs solving.</p>

            <p>Balancing expenses with income is the fundamental challenge of personal finance. Understanding exactly what you spend is the first step to achieving that balance.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
