            <p class="intro">Net income is the money you actually receive after taxes and other deductions are taken out. It's often called "take-home pay" because it's what you take home from your paycheck.</p>

            <p>Understanding net income is essential for budgeting. This is the real amount you have available to spend, save, and use for bills.</p>

            <h2>Net Income vs. Gross Income</h2>

            <p>These two terms are often confused, but they mean very different things.</p>

            <h3>Gross Income</h3>
            <p>Gross income is your total earnings before anything is deducted. When a job offer says "$50,000 per year," that's gross income.</p>

            <p>If you work 40 hours at $25 per hour, your gross weekly income is $1,000. That's the amount before taxes and deductions.</p>

            <h3>Net Income</h3>
            <p>Net income is what remains after deductions. It's your gross income minus taxes, insurance, retirement contributions, and any other deductions.</p>

            <p>From that $1,000 gross weekly income, you might receive $750 in your bank account. That $750 is your net income—your actual take-home pay.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Simple Comparison</h4>
                <p><strong>Gross Income:</strong> What you earned</p>
                <p><strong>Net Income:</strong> What you received</p>
                <p><strong>The Difference:</strong> Taxes and deductions</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What Gets Deducted?</h2>

            <p>Several things are typically taken from your gross income before you receive your paycheck.</p>

            <h3>Federal Income Tax</h3>
            <p>The federal government requires tax withholding from most paychecks. The amount depends on your income level and tax filing status.</p>

            <p>Someone earning $50,000 might have about $5,000-$7,000 withheld annually for federal income tax, though this varies significantly.</p>

            <h3>State and Local Taxes</h3>
            <p>Most states (not all) have state income tax. Some cities and counties also have local income taxes.</p>

            <p>State tax rates vary widely. Some states like Texas and Florida have no state income tax. Others like California have rates up to 13% on higher incomes.</p>

            <h3>Social Security and Medicare (FICA)</h3>
            <p>These are mandatory federal payroll taxes. Social Security takes 6.2% of your gross income (up to a limit). Medicare takes 1.45%.</p>

            <p>On $4,000 gross monthly income, you'd pay $248 for Social Security and $58 for Medicare, totaling $306 in FICA taxes.</p>

            <h3>Health Insurance Premiums</h3>
            <p>If you have employer-provided health insurance, your portion of the premium is usually deducted from your paycheck.</p>

            <p>This might be $100, $200, or more per month depending on your plan and coverage level.</p>

            <h3>Retirement Contributions</h3>
            <p>If you contribute to a 401(k) or similar retirement plan through work, that amount comes out before you receive your pay.</p>

            <p>Contributing 5% of a $5,000 monthly gross income means $250 goes to retirement, reducing your take-home pay by that amount.</p>

            <h3>Other Possible Deductions</h3>
            <p>Additional deductions might include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Dental and vision insurance</li>
                <li>Life insurance</li>
                <li>Flexible Spending Account (FSA) contributions</li>
                <li>Health Savings Account (HSA) contributions</li>
                <li>Union dues</li>
                <li>Garnishments (if applicable)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Calculating Net Income: Example</h2>

            <p>Here's how gross income becomes net income in a realistic scenario.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Monthly Paycheck Breakdown</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Gross Monthly Income:</strong> $5,000</p>
                
                <p><strong>Deductions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Federal income tax: $625</li>
                    <li>State income tax: $200</li>
                    <li>Social Security (6.2%): $310</li>
                    <li>Medicare (1.45%): $73</li>
                    <li>Health insurance: $180</li>
                    <li>401(k) contribution (6%): $300</li>
                    <li>Dental insurance: $25</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Total Deductions:</strong> $1,713</p>
                
                <p><strong>Net Monthly Income:</strong> $3,287</p>
            </div>

            <p>This person's gross income is $5,000, but their net income—what actually hits their bank account—is $3,287. That's about 66% of gross income.</p>

            <h2>Why Net Income Matters for Budgeting</h2>

            <p>When creating a budget, always use net income, not gross income. Your net income is what you have available to spend.</p>

            <p>Someone earning $60,000 gross annually might think they have $5,000 per month to work with. But if their net income is only $3,800 per month, budgeting for $5,000 will create serious problems.</p>

            <h3>Common Budgeting Mistake</h3>
            <p>Many beginners budget using gross income and wonder why they always run short on money. The issue is they're planning to spend money they never actually receive.</p>

            <p>Always check your actual paycheck amount—your net income—and budget from that number.</p>

            <h2>Finding Your Net Income</h2>

            <p>Your pay stub shows both gross and net income clearly. Look for these terms:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gross Pay:</strong> Total earnings before deductions</li>
                <li><strong>Deductions:</strong> Everything taken out</li>
                <li><strong>Net Pay:</strong> Final amount deposited to your account</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The net pay amount matches what appears in your bank account on payday.</p>

            <h2>Annual vs. Monthly Net Income</h2>

            <p>You can calculate net income for any time period.</p>

            <h3>Annual Net Income</h3>
            <p>To find annual net income, add up all the net pay from your paychecks for the year. Or multiply your typical monthly net income by 12.</p>

            <p>If you receive $3,200 net per month, your annual net income is approximately $38,400.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Net Income</h3>
            <p>For monthly budgeting, use your monthly net income. If you're paid biweekly, you'll receive two paychecks most months and three paychecks twice a year.</p>

            <p>Many people budget based on receiving two paychecks per month and treat the third paycheck (when it occurs) as extra for savings or irregular expenses.</p>

            <h2>Increasing Net Income</h2>

            <p>There are two main ways to increase your net income: earn more or reduce deductions.</p>

            <h3>Earning More</h3>
            <p>Getting a raise, switching to a higher-paying job, or adding income sources increases gross income, which typically increases net income too (though higher earnings mean higher taxes).</p>

            <h3>Reducing Deductions</h3>
            <p>Some deductions are mandatory (taxes, FICA), but others are optional or adjustable:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reduce retirement contributions (though this affects long-term savings)</li>
                <li>Choose a health insurance plan with lower premiums</li>
                <li>Adjust tax withholding if you consistently get large refunds</li>
                <li>Drop optional insurance if not needed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Be careful reducing beneficial deductions like retirement savings. The goal is to optimize, not just maximize take-home pay at the expense of future security.</p>

            <h2>Net Income for Different Income Types</h2>

            <h3>Self-Employment</h3>
            <p>If you're self-employed, you receive the gross amount from clients. You're responsible for setting aside money for taxes yourself.</p>

            <p>A freelancer who earns $5,000 in a month receives the full $5,000. But they need to save approximately 25-30% for taxes, leaving about $3,500-$3,750 as true net income.</p>

            <h3>Multiple Jobs</h3>
            <p>If you have multiple income sources, calculate net income for each separately, then add them together.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Multiple Income Sources</h4>
                <p><strong>Main job net income:</strong> $2,800/month</p>
                <p><strong>Weekend job net income:</strong> $450/month</p>
                <p><strong>Total net income:</strong> $3,250/month</p>
            </div>
