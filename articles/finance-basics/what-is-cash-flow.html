            <p class="intro">Cash flow is the movement of money in and out of your accounts. Money coming in (like your paycheck) is cash inflow. Money going out (like paying bills) is cash outflow.</p>

            <p>Understanding your cash flow helps you see whether you're gaining money, losing money, or breaking even each month.</p>

            <h2>How Cash Flow Works</h2>

            <p>Think of cash flow like water flowing through a pipe. Money flows into your checking account from various sources. Money flows out when you spend or pay bills.</p>

            <p>The difference between what flows in and what flows out determines your cash flow situation.</p>

            <h3>Cash Inflow (Money Coming In)</h3>
            <p>Cash inflow includes any money you receive:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Paycheck from your job</li>
                <li>Freelance or side gig payments</li>
                <li>Tax refunds</li>
                <li>Government benefits</li>
                <li>Gifts or bonuses</li>
                <li>Money transferred from savings</li>
                <li>Refunds or reimbursements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you receive a $3,000 paycheck, that's $3,000 of cash inflow for the month.</p>

            <h3>Cash Outflow (Money Going Out)</h3>
            <p>Cash outflow is any money you spend or transfer out:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Rent or mortgage payment</li>
                <li>Utility bills</li>
                <li>Groceries and gas</li>
                <li>Credit card payments</li>
                <li>Loan payments</li>
                <li>Money transferred to savings</li>
                <li>Subscriptions and services</li>
                <li>Any other purchases</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you pay $1,200 rent, $150 utilities, $400 groceries, and $800 in other expenses, that's $2,550 of cash outflow.</p>

            <h2>Positive vs. Negative Cash Flow</h2>

            <p>Your cash flow is either positive, negative, or neutral depending on the relationship between inflow and outflow.</p>

            <h3>Positive Cash Flow</h3>
            <p>Positive cash flow means more money comes in than goes out. You're gaining money each period.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Positive Cash Flow</h4>
                <p><strong>Monthly Cash Inflow:</strong> $3,800</p>
                <p><strong>Monthly Cash Outflow:</strong> $3,200</p>
                <p><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> +$600 (positive)</p>
            </div>

            <p>This person has $600 left over at the end of the month. They can save it, invest it, or spend it on extra things.</p>

            <h3>Negative Cash Flow</h3>
            <p>Negative cash flow means more money goes out than comes in. You're losing money each period.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Negative Cash Flow</h4>
                <p><strong>Monthly Cash Inflow:</strong> $3,200</p>
                <p><strong>Monthly Cash Outflow:</strong> $3,600</p>
                <p><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> -$400 (negative)</p>
            </div>

            <p>This person is short $400 each month. They need to either reduce spending, increase income, or use savings/credit to cover the gap.</p>

            <h3>Neutral Cash Flow</h3>
            <p>Neutral cash flow means inflow and outflow are equal. You break even—nothing gained, nothing lost.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Neutral Cash Flow</h4>
                <p><strong>Monthly Cash Inflow:</strong> $3,500</p>
                <p><strong>Monthly Cash Outflow:</strong> $3,500</p>
                <p><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> $0 (neutral)</p>
            </div>

            <p>This person uses every dollar they earn. They're not saving or going into debt, just maintaining the status quo.</p>

            <h2>Why Cash Flow Matters</h2>

            <p>Monitoring cash flow helps you understand your financial health at a glance. It answers the critical question: "Am I gaining or losing ground financially?"</p>

            <h3>Avoiding Financial Trouble</h3>
            <p>Persistent negative cash flow leads to problems. If you consistently spend more than you earn, you'll eventually run out of savings or accumulate debt.</p>

            <p>Catching negative cash flow early lets you make adjustments before serious issues develop.</p>

            <h3>Building Wealth</h3>
            <p>Positive cash flow is essential for building wealth. The money left over each month can go toward savings, investments, or paying down debt.</p>

            <p>Someone with $500 positive cash flow each month has $6,000 per year to build wealth. Over time, this compounds significantly.</p>

            <h3>Financial Flexibility</h3>
            <p>Strong positive cash flow gives you options. You can handle unexpected expenses, save for goals, or make strategic financial moves.</p>

            <h2>Calculating Your Cash Flow</h2>

            <p>To calculate cash flow, subtract total outflow from total inflow for a specific period.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Cash Flow Calculation</h3>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Sarah's Monthly Cash Flow</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Cash Inflow:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Salary (net): $3,400</li>
                    <li>Freelance work: $300</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Inflow: $3,700</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Cash Outflow:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent: $1,200</li>
                    <li>Utilities: $140</li>
                    <li>Groceries: $380</li>
                    <li>Car payment: $280</li>
                    <li>Insurance: $160</li>
                    <li>Gas: $100</li>
                    <li>Phone: $75</li>
                    <li>Eating out: $180</li>
                    <li>Entertainment: $120</li>
                    <li>Misc: $100</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Outflow: $2,735</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Cash Flow: $3,700 - $2,735 = +$965</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Sarah has positive monthly cash flow of $965. This is money she can save, invest, or use for other financial goals.</p>

            <h2>Improving Cash Flow</h2>

            <p>If your cash flow is negative or you want to increase positive cash flow, you have two main options: increase inflow or decrease outflow.</p>

            <h3>Increasing Cash Inflow</h3>
            <p>Ways to bring more money in:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ask for a raise at work</li>
                <li>Take on extra hours or overtime</li>
                <li>Start a side gig or freelance work</li>
                <li>Sell items you no longer need</li>
                <li>Find a higher-paying job</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Adding even $200-$300 per month in extra income can shift negative cash flow to positive or boost your savings rate significantly.</p>

            <h3>Decreasing Cash Outflow</h3>
            <p>Ways to reduce money going out:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cut unnecessary subscriptions</li>
                <li>Reduce eating out frequency</li>
                <li>Find cheaper insurance rates</li>
                <li>Lower utility usage</li>
                <li>Use grocery lists to avoid impulse purchases</li>
                <li>Refinance loans for lower payments</li>
                <li>Move to cheaper housing (if feasible)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Finding $300 in monthly spending to cut has the same effect on cash flow as earning an extra $300.</p>

            <h2>Cash Flow vs. Income</h2>

            <p>Cash flow and income are related but different concepts.</p>

            <p>Income is just the money coming in. Cash flow considers both income and spending to show your net position.</p>

            <p>Someone earning $100,000 per year (high income) could have negative cash flow if they spend $110,000. Someone earning $40,000 (lower income) could have positive cash flow if they spend only $35,000.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Cash Flow Over Time</h2>

            <p>Monitoring cash flow month to month reveals patterns and trends.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Tracking</h3>
            <p>Check your cash flow at the end of each month. Are you consistently positive? Is the amount growing? Are there problem months?</p>

            <p>If you're positive most months but negative in December due to holiday spending, you can plan for that by saving extra in other months.</p>

            <h3>Spotting Trends</h3>
            <p>Three months of declining cash flow signals a developing problem. Six months of increasing positive cash flow shows improving financial health.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: 6-Month Cash Flow Trend</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>January: +$450</li>
                    <li>February: +$520</li>
                    <li>March: +$380</li>
                    <li>April: +$600</li>
                    <li>May: +$490</li>
                    <li>June: +$550</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Average: +$498/month</strong></p>
                <p>Trend: Positive and stable</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Common Cash Flow Challenges</h2>

            <h3>Irregular Income</h3>
            <p>Freelancers and commission workers have fluctuating cash inflow. Some months are high, others low.</p>

            <p>Solution: Budget based on your lowest typical month. Save excess from high months to cover low months.</p>

            <h3>Large Irregular Expenses</h3>
            <p>Annual insurance premiums, property taxes, or irregular car repairs can create negative cash flow in specific months.</p>

            <p>Solution: Set aside money monthly for these known expenses so they don't disrupt cash flow when due.</p>

            <h3>Seasonal Variations</h3>
            <p>Utility bills spike in summer/winter. Holiday spending increases in November/December.</p>

            <p>Solution: Expect these variations and plan for higher outflow in certain months.</p>
