                <p>Personal finance basics aren't taught in most schools, which means many adults feel lost when managing money. The good news? The fundamentals are straightforward and anyone can learn them.</p>

<h2>Basic 1: Understand Your Income</h2>

<p>Your <a href="what-is-income.html">income</a> is all the money you receive. For most people, this is mainly a paycheck from work.</p>

<p><strong>Gross income:</strong> What you earn before taxes and deductions</p>
<p><strong>Net income (take-home pay):</strong> What actually goes into your bank account</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Your salary is $50,000 per year (gross). After taxes and deductions, you receive $3,200 per month (net). Budget based on the $3,200 you actually receive, not the full $50,000.</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> You can only spend what you actually receive. Budgeting based on gross income leads to overspending.</p>

<h2>Basic 2: Track Your Expenses</h2>

<p>Expenses are everything you spend money on. They fall into two main categories covered in our guide on <a href="fixed-vs-variable-expenses.html">fixed vs variable expenses</a>:</p>

<h3>Fixed Expenses (Same Every Month)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Rent or mortgage</li>
    <li>Car payment</li>
    <li>Insurance premiums</li>
    <li>Subscription services</li>
</ul>

<h3>Variable Expenses (Change Monthly)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Groceries</li>
    <li>Gas</li>
    <li>Utilities</li>
    <li>Entertainment</li>
    <li>Dining out</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action step:</strong> For one month, write down every expense. This shows you exactly where your money goes and often reveals surprising spending patterns.</p>

<h2>Basic 3: Create a Simple Budget</h2>

<p>A budget is just a plan for your money before the month begins. The simplest approach:</p>

<p><strong>Income - Expenses = $0 (or positive)</strong></p>

<p>If your income is $3,200 and expenses total $3,200, you've balanced your budget. If expenses exceed income, you need to cut spending or earn more.</p>

<p><strong>50/30/20 shortcut:</strong> If detailed budgeting feels overwhelming, try the <a href="../budgeting/50-30-20-budget-rule.html">50/30/20 budget rule</a>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>50% for needs (housing, food, utilities, minimum debt payments)</li>
    <li>30% for wants (entertainment, dining out, hobbies)</li>
    <li>20% for savings and extra debt payments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic 4: Build an Emergency Fund</h2>

<p>An emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected expenses - car repairs, medical bills, job loss.</p>

<p><strong>Start small:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>First goal: $500-1,000</li>
    <li>Next goal: 1 month of expenses</li>
    <li>Final goal: 3-6 months of expenses</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If your monthly expenses are $2,500, aim for $7,500-15,000 in your emergency fund eventually. But start with just $500.</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without emergency savings, one unexpected expense forces you into debt. With savings, you handle problems without financial crisis.</p>

<h2>Basic 5: Understand Debt</h2>

<p>Debt is money you owe. It comes with interest, which is the cost of borrowing.</p>

<p><strong>Credit card debt:</strong> Often the most expensive, with rates of 15-25%. Carrying balances costs you hundreds or thousands in interest.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> A $2,000 credit card balance at 20% APR costs you $400 per year in interest if you don't pay it down.</p>

<p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Pay off high-interest debt as quickly as possible. It's like earning that interest rate in return - paying off a 20% interest debt is like earning 20% on an investment.</p>

<h2>Basic 6: Pay Yourself First</h2>

<p>"Pay yourself first" means saving before spending on other things.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong> When your paycheck arrives, immediately move money to savings before paying bills or spending on anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Your paycheck is $3,200. You transfer $320 (10%) to savings right away, then budget the remaining $2,880 for expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> If you wait to save "whatever's left," there's usually nothing left. Saving first ensures it actually happens.</p>

<h2>Basic 7: Start Retirement Savings Early</h2>

<p>Retirement seems far away, but starting early makes a massive difference.</p>

<p><strong>The power of time:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Start at 25, save $200/month until 65 = $473,000 (assuming 7% return)</li>
    <li>Start at 35, save $200/month until 65 = $227,000</li>
    <li>Start at 45, save $200/month until 65 = $98,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting 10 years earlier more than doubles your retirement savings, even with the same monthly amount.</p>

<p><strong>Where to start:</strong> If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match - it's free money.</p>

<h2>Basic 8: Build and Protect Your Credit</h2>

<p>Your <a href="../credit-debt/what-is-credit-score.html">credit score</a> affects interest rates, apartment approvals, and sometimes job opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Simple credit building:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Pay all bills on time, every time</li>
    <li>Keep credit card balances low (under 30% of limit)</li>
    <li>Don't close old credit cards</li>
    <li>Don't apply for too much new credit at once</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Good credit can save you tens of thousands in interest over your lifetime. Bad credit costs you more for loans, credit cards, insurance, and housing.</p>

<h2>Basic 9: Avoid Lifestyle Inflation</h2>

<p>Lifestyle inflation is when spending increases as income increases.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You get a $500/month raise. Instead of saving it, you upgrade your apartment, buy a nicer car, and eat out more. Your new expenses consume the raise, leaving you no better off financially.</p>

<p><strong>Better approach:</strong> When you earn more, save at least half the increase. Enjoy some, but don't let your lifestyle expand to consume all additional income.</p>

<h2>Basic 10: Educate Yourself Continuously</h2>

<p>Personal finance isn't static - your knowledge should grow over time.</p>

<p><strong>Free resources:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Library books on personal finance</li>
    <li>Reputable personal finance websites and blogs</li>
    <li>Financial literacy courses online</li>
    <li>Podcasts about money management</li>
</ul>

<p>The more you learn, the better financial decisions you'll make. Start with basics, then expand your knowledge as you master each concept.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Don't try to implement everything at once. Start here:</p>

<ol>
    <li>This week: Track every expense using <a href="../budgeting/how-to-track-expenses-manually.html">expense tracking methods</a></li>
    <li>This month: Create a simple budget</li>
    <li>Next month: Start saving for an emergency fund</li>
    <li>Next quarter: Review and adjust your budget</li>
    <li>This year: Build your emergency fund to $1,000</li>
</ol>

<p>Small, consistent actions compound into major financial improvements over time. You don't need to be perfect - you just need to start and keep learning.</p>
