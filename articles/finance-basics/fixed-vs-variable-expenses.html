            <p class="intro">Fixed expenses stay the same every month, while variable expenses change. Understanding the difference helps you budget more accurately and identify where you have flexibility in your spending.</p>

            <p>Both types of expenses are normal parts of any budget. The key is knowing which is which so you can plan accordingly.</p>

            <h2>What Are Fixed Expenses?</h2>

            <p>Fixed expenses are costs that stay the same amount each month. You know exactly how much you'll pay, and it doesn't change unless you make a deliberate change.</p>

            <p>These expenses are predictable. If your rent is $1,200 this month, it'll be $1,200 next month too (unless your lease changes).</p>

            <h3>Common Fixed Expenses</h3>

            <p>Here are typical fixed expenses most people have:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rent or mortgage payment:</strong> $1,200 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Car payment:</strong> $315 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Car insurance:</strong> $140 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Health insurance premium:</strong> $200 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Phone plan:</strong> $75 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Internet service:</strong> $60 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Streaming subscriptions:</strong> $35 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Gym membership:</strong> $40 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Student loan payment:</strong> $250 per month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Notice these amounts don't fluctuate. You owe the same amount whether it's January or July, whether you use the service a lot or a little.</p>

            <h3>Why Fixed Expenses Are Predictable</h3>

            <p>Fixed expenses are usually based on contracts or agreements. Your lease agreement sets your rent. Your loan contract determines your car payment. Your insurance policy specifies your premium.</p>

            <p>This predictability makes budgeting easier. You can count on these exact amounts when planning your monthly spending.</p>

            <h2>What Are Variable Expenses?</h2>

            <p>Variable expenses change from month to month. The amount you pay depends on your usage, choices, or circumstances.</p>

            <p>These expenses are less predictable. Your grocery bill might be $320 one month and $450 another, depending on what you buy and how often you shop.</p>

            <h3>Common Variable Expenses</h3>

            <p>Here are typical variable expenses:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Groceries:</strong> $300-$500 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Gas for car:</strong> $80-$150 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Electric bill:</strong> $60-$120 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Water bill:</strong> $30-$50 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Eating out:</strong> $100-$300 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> $50-$200 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> $0-$200 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Personal care:</strong> $40-$100 per month</li>
                <li><strong>Home maintenance:</strong> $0-$300 per month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These amounts fluctuate based on behavior and circumstances. You might not buy any clothes for three months, then spend $200 in one month.</p>

            <h3>Why Variable Expenses Change</h3>

            <p>Variable expenses depend on consumption or discretionary choices. You use more electricity in summer when running the AC, so the bill increases. You buy more groceries when hosting a dinner party.</p>

            <p>Some variable expenses are within your control (eating out, entertainment), while others are partially controllable (utilities, groceries). This is where you have the most flexibility to adjust spending.</p>

            <h2>Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Jordan's Monthly Budget</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Fixed Expenses:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent: $1,150</li>
                    <li>Car payment: $280</li>
                    <li>Car insurance: $135</li>
                    <li>Phone: $70</li>
                    <li>Internet: $55</li>
                    <li>Streaming services: $30</li>
                    <li>Gym: $45</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Fixed: $1,765</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Variable Expenses:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Groceries: $380</li>
                    <li>Gas: $110</li>
                    <li>Electric: $85</li>
                    <li>Water: $35</li>
                    <li>Eating out: $180</li>
                    <li>Entertainment: $90</li>
                    <li>Clothing: $60</li>
                    <li>Miscellaneous: $75</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Variable: $1,015</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Total Monthly Expenses: $2,780</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Jordan's fixed expenses are the same every month. The variable expenses shown here are averages—actual amounts will differ month to month.</p>

            <h2>The Gray Area: Semi-Variable Expenses</h2>

            <p>Some expenses fall between fixed and variable. They have a predictable component but can fluctuate within a range.</p>

            <h3>Examples of Semi-Variable Expenses</h3>

            <p>Utilities like electricity and water are semi-variable. You'll always have a bill, but the amount changes based on usage. Your electric bill might range from $70 to $120, but it won't be $0 or $300 (under normal circumstances).</p>

            <p>Cell phone bills can be semi-variable too. You might have a $50 base plan but pay extra if you exceed data limits or make international calls.</p>

            <p>For budgeting purposes, most people treat semi-variable expenses as variable and estimate based on typical or average amounts.</p>

            <h2>Why This Distinction Matters</h2>

            <h3>Budgeting Accuracy</h3>
            <p>Knowing your fixed expenses gives you a reliable baseline. If your fixed expenses total $1,800, you know that amount is committed every month before considering anything else.</p>

            <p>For variable expenses, you estimate based on history and goals. If groceries average $400, budget for that amount while knowing it might be higher or lower.</p>

            <h3>Cutting Costs</h3>
            <p>Variable expenses are usually easier to reduce quickly. If money is tight, you can immediately spend less on eating out, entertainment, or clothing.</p>

            <p>Fixed expenses are harder to change. To reduce rent, you'd need to move. To lower car insurance, you'd need to shop for a new policy. These changes require more time and effort.</p>

            <h3>Financial Flexibility</h3>
            <p>The ratio of fixed to variable expenses affects your financial flexibility. Someone with $2,000 in fixed expenses and $500 in variable expenses has less room to adjust than someone with $1,200 fixed and $1,300 variable.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Two Different Scenarios</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Person A:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed: $2,500</li>
                    <li>Variable: $700</li>
                    <li>Total: $3,200</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Person A has limited flexibility. Most spending is locked in.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Person B:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed: $1,600</li>
                    <li>Variable: $1,600</li>
                    <li>Total: $3,200</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Person B has more flexibility. Half of spending is adjustable.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Managing Fixed Expenses</h2>

            <p>While fixed expenses are harder to change, you can still optimize them over time.</p>

            <h3>Review Annually</h3>
            <p>Check your fixed expenses once a year. Can you get cheaper car insurance? Is there a better phone plan? Are you using all those subscriptions?</p>

            <p>Even small reductions in fixed expenses create permanent monthly savings. Cutting $30 from your phone bill saves $360 per year, every year.</p>

            <h3>Avoid Adding Fixed Expenses</h3>
            <p>Before committing to a new fixed expense, consider the long-term impact. A $50 monthly subscription costs $600 per year. Make sure it's worth that amount.</p>

            <h2>Managing Variable Expenses</h2>

            <p>Variable expenses offer the most control over your budget.</p>

            <h3>Track Patterns</h3>
            <p>Monitor variable expenses for a few months to understand your patterns. You might spend more on groceries than you thought, or less on entertainment.</p>

            <p>Use your actual spending history to set realistic budget amounts. If you consistently spend $450 on groceries, don't budget $300—that's setting yourself up to fail.</p>

            <h3>Set Spending Limits</h3>
            <p>Once you know your patterns, you can set intentional limits. If you want to save more, decide to cap eating out at $150 instead of your usual $250.</p>

            <p>Variable expenses are where most people find money to save or redirect toward goals.</p>
