                    <h1>What is Principal?</h1>
                    <p class="article-meta">5 min read</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Principal is the original amount of money you borrow or invest, before any interest is added. When you take out a loan, the principal is how much you actually borrowed. When you invest money, the principal is how much you put in.</p>

                    <p>Think of principal as the starting point. If you borrow $10,000 for a car, that $10,000 is your principal. Any interest you pay on top of that is separate from the principal.</p>

                    <h2>Principal in Loans</h2>

                    <p>When you take out a loan, the principal is the amount the lender gives you. This is different from the total you'll pay back, which includes interest.</p>

                    <p>For example, you borrow $5,000 for a personal loan. The $5,000 is your principal. Over time, you might pay back $5,750 total. The $5,000 is principal, and the extra $750 is interest.</p>

                    <h2>How Loan Payments Work</h2>

                    <p>Each loan payment typically includes two parts: principal and interest. Part of your payment reduces the principal you owe. The other part pays the interest charges.</p>

                    <p>Early in a loan, most of your payment goes toward interest. Later on, more of your payment goes toward principal. This is how loans are structured.</p>

                    <p>On a $200,000 mortgage, your first payment might split like this: $200 toward principal and $800 toward interest. Years later, a payment might be $700 principal and $300 interest.</p>

                    <h2>Principal in Savings and Investments</h2>

                    <p>When you save or invest money, your principal is the amount you put in. Any earnings from interest or investment gains are separate from your principal.</p>

                    <p>If you deposit $1,000 into a savings account, that $1,000 is your principal. If you earn $30 in interest over a year, you now have $1,030 total. Your principal is still $1,000, and you have $30 in interest earnings.</p>

                    <h2>Why Principal Matters</h2>

                    <p>Understanding principal helps you see how much you actually owe or have saved. It separates the base amount from additional costs or earnings.</p>

                    <p>This matters for budgeting and planning. If you know your loan principal is $15,000, you understand the actual debt amount. The interest is the cost of borrowing that money.</p>

                    <h2>Paying Down Principal Faster</h2>

                    <p>Making extra payments toward principal reduces what you owe. Since interest is calculated on your remaining principal, lowering it means paying less interest overall.</p>

                    <p>Let's say you owe $8,000 on a loan and make an extra $100 principal payment. Your balance drops to $7,900. Next month's interest is calculated on $7,900 instead of $8,000, saving you money.</p>

                    <p>On a $300,000 mortgage at 6% interest, paying an extra $200 toward principal each month could save you over $70,000 in interest and pay off the loan years earlier.</p>

                    <h2>Principal and Interest Statements</h2>

                    <p>Loan statements show your principal balance separately from interest charges. The principal balance is what you still owe on the original borrowed amount.</p>

                    <p>Each month, you'll see how much of your payment went to principal versus interest. Over time, you'll watch your principal balance decrease.</p>

                    <h2>Credit Card Principal</h2>

                    <p>With credit cards, principal works a bit differently. The principal is your current balance before new interest is added. When you make purchases, those amounts add to your principal.</p>

                    <p>If you have a $1,500 credit card balance and make a $100 payment, about $25 might go to interest and $75 to principal. Your new principal balance would be $1,425.</p>

                    <h2>Principal-Only Payments</h2>

                    <p>Some loans let you make principal-only payments. These payments go entirely toward reducing your loan principal, not toward interest.</p>

                    <p>These payments are usually in addition to your regular payment. They help you pay off the loan faster and save on total interest costs.</p>

                    <h2>Real-World Principal Examples</h2>

                    <p>Student loans often start with a principal amount of $20,000 to $50,000 or more. This is the total you borrowed for school. Interest adds up over time, but the principal is the original borrowed amount.</p>

                    <p>Car loans typically have principals of $15,000 to $40,000. A $25,000 car loan at 5% for five years means your principal is $25,000. You'll pay about $3,300 in interest on top of that.</p>

                    <p>If you invest $3,000 in a retirement account, that's your principal investment. If it grows to $3,500 over a year, your principal is still $3,000 and your gain is $500.</p>

                    <h2>Principal Protection</h2>

                    <p>When investing, some products offer principal protection. This means your original investment amount is guaranteed, even if the investment loses value.</p>

                    <p>These products ensure you won't lose your principal, though you might not earn any returns either. Regular investments can lose principal value if the market goes down.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Principal is the original amount borrowed or invested, before interest</li>
                        <li>For loans, it's how much you borrowed; for savings, it's how much you put in</li>

                        <li>Paying extra toward principal saves money on total interest</li>
                        <li>Your principal balance decreases as you make loan payments</li>
                        <li>On a $10,000 loan, the $10,000 is principal; any interest is extra</li>
                        <li>Understanding principal helps you track your actual debt or savings amount</li>
                    </ul>
