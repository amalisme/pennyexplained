                    <p>Compound interest is when you earn interest on both your original money and the interest you've already earned. It's interest on top of interest. This makes your money grow faster over time compared to simple interest.</p>

                    <p>Think of it like a snowball rolling down a hill. It starts small, but as it rolls, it picks up more snow and gets bigger. The bigger it gets, the more snow it picks up with each roll.</p>

                    <h2>How Compound Interest Works</h2>

                    <p>With compound interest, your money earns interest in periods (like monthly or yearly). After each period, that interest gets added to your original amount. Then in the next period, you earn interest on this new, larger amount.</p>

                    <p>Here's a simple example. You save $1,000 in an account that pays 5% interest per year. After one year, you earn $50 in interest, giving you $1,050 total.</p>

                    <p>In year two, you don't just earn interest on your original $1,000. You earn 5% on the full $1,050. That's $52.50 in interest. Your new total is $1,102.50.</p>

                    <h2>Compound Interest vs Simple Interest</h2>

                    <p>Simple interest only pays you interest on your original amount. Compound interest pays you interest on your growing total.</p>

                    <p>Let's compare with $1,000 at 5% for three years. With simple interest, you earn $50 each year for a total of $150. Your final amount is $1,150.</p>

                    <p>With compound interest, you earn $50 in year one, $52.50 in year two, and $55.13 in year three. That's $157.63 total, giving you $1,157.63. You made an extra $7.63 just from compounding.</p>

                    <h2>Why Time Matters</h2>

                    <p>Compound interest gets more powerful over longer periods. The difference between simple and compound interest is small at first but grows significantly over time.</p>

                    <p>If you invested $5,000 at 7% for 10 years with simple interest, you'd have $8,500. With compound interest (compounded yearly), you'd have about $9,836. That's $1,336 more.</p>

                    <p>Over 30 years, that same $5,000 would grow to $15,500 with simple interest but to about $38,061 with compound interest. The difference becomes huge.</p>

                    <h2>How Often Interest Compounds</h2>

                    <p>Interest can compound at different frequencies. Common periods include daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The more frequently interest compounds, the more you earn.</p>

                    <p>Take $10,000 at 6% annual interest for one year. Compounded yearly, you'd earn $600. Compounded monthly, you'd earn about $617. Compounded daily, you'd earn about $618.</p>

                    <p>The differences seem small in one year, but over many years, they add up. Most savings accounts compound daily, which works in your favor.</p>

                    <h2>Real-World Compound Interest Examples</h2>

                    <p>Savings accounts use compound interest. If you put $2,000 in a savings account earning 3% compounded monthly, after five years you'd have about $2,323 without adding any more money.</p>

                    <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) also use compound interest. A $5,000 CD at 4% compounded quarterly for three years would grow to about $5,635.</p>

                    <p>Credit card debt also compounds, but against you. If you owe $3,000 on a card with 20% APR compounded daily and only pay minimums, your debt grows quickly through compound interest.</p>

                    <h2>The Rule of 72</h2>

                    <p>There's a simple trick to estimate how long it takes money to double with compound interest. Divide 72 by the interest rate.</p>

                    <p>At 6% interest, your money doubles in about 12 years (72 ÷ 6 = 12). At 8% interest, it doubles in about 9 years (72 ÷ 8 = 9).</p>

                    <p>This rule helps you quickly understand the power of different interest rates. A 10% return doubles your money in roughly 7.2 years, while a 3% return takes about 24 years.</p>

                    <h2>Compound Interest and Regular Deposits</h2>

                    <p>Compound interest becomes even more powerful when you regularly add money. This combines the benefit of compounding with consistent saving.</p>

                    <p>If you save $200 per month in an account earning 6% annually (compounded monthly), after 10 years you'd have about $32,776. You put in $24,000, but earned about $8,776 in compound interest.</p>

                    <p>After 20 years of the same $200 monthly deposits, you'd have about $92,408. You contributed $48,000, but compound interest added about $44,408. That's nearly as much as you saved.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding the Formula</h2>

                    <p>The compound interest formula looks complex, but the concept is simple. You're calculating your original amount times (1 plus the interest rate) raised to the power of how many times it compounds.</p>

                    <p>Banks and financial institutions handle these calculations automatically. Online calculators can also show you how compound interest affects specific amounts over time.</p>

                    <h2>Both Sides of Compound Interest</h2>

                    <p>Compound interest works for you in savings and investments. Your money grows faster than with simple interest, especially over long periods.</p>

                    <p>But compound interest works against you in debt. Credit card balances, unpaid loans, and other debts grow through compound interest if you don't pay them off.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Compound interest is interest earned on both your original money and previous interest</li>
                        <li>It makes money grow faster than simple interest over time</li>
                        <li>The longer money compounds, the more it grows</li>
                        <li>More frequent compounding (like daily vs yearly) means slightly more growth</li>
                        <li>$1,000 at 5% for 10 years grows to about $1,629 with compound interest</li>
                        <li>Compound interest helps savings grow but also makes debt grow faster</li>
                        <li>Time is the most important factor in compound interest</li>
                    </ul>
