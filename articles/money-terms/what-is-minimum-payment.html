                    <h1>What is Minimum Payment?</h1>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The minimum payment is the smallest amount you can pay on your credit card bill each month without being considered late. It's usually a small percentage of your total balance, typically 1% to 3% of what you owe, or a fixed dollar amount like $25 to $35, whichever is higher.</p>

                    <p>Think of it as the bare minimum the credit card company will accept. You can always pay more than the minimum, but paying less will result in late fees and other penalties.</p>

                    <h2>How Minimum Payments Are Calculated</h2>

                    <p>Credit card companies use different formulas to calculate minimum payments. Most commonly, it's a percentage of your balance plus any fees and interest charges.</p>

                    <p>A typical calculation is 1% to 2% of your balance, plus any interest and fees from that month. Some cards use a flat percentage like 2% to 3% of your total balance, with a minimum floor amount.</p>

                    <p>For example, if you owe $2,000 and your card requires 2% minimum payment, your minimum would be $40. If you owe $500, your 2% minimum would be $10, but most cards have a minimum floor of $25 or $35, so you'd pay that instead.</p>

                    <h2>Where to Find Your Minimum Payment</h2>

                    <p>Your minimum payment appears on your monthly credit card statement. It's usually shown prominently on the first page, along with your total balance and payment due date.</p>

                    <p>You can also find it in your online account or mobile app. Credit card companies make this easy to see because they want you to know what to pay to avoid late fees.</p>

                    <h2>What Happens If You Only Pay the Minimum</h2>

                    <p>Paying only the minimum keeps your account in good standing, but it means you'll pay a lot more in interest over time and take much longer to pay off the balance.</p>

                    <p>Here's an example. You have a $3,000 balance on a card with 20% APR. If your minimum payment is $60 per month (2%) and you only pay minimums, it would take you over 30 years to pay off the balance and cost you about $7,000 in interest.</p>

                    <p>If you paid $150 per month instead, you'd pay off the same balance in about 2 years and pay only about $600 in interest. That's a huge difference.</p>

                    <h2>Why Minimum Payments Are Small</h2>

                    <p>Credit card companies set low minimum payments to make monthly bills feel more manageable. This encourages people to use their cards and carry balances.</p>

                    <p>When you carry a balance, you pay interest. The longer you take to pay off the balance, the more interest the credit card company earns. This is why minimum payments are designed to be affordable but slow to reduce your debt.</p>

                    <h2>The Real Cost of Minimums</h2>

                    <p>Let's look at a $5,000 balance at 18% APR. With a typical 2% minimum payment starting at $100, paying only minimums would take about 387 months (over 32 years) to pay off. You'd pay about $11,680 in interest.</p>

                    <p>But if you paid $200 per month, you'd pay off the balance in about 32 months and pay only about $1,332 in interest. Doubling your payment saves you over $10,000 and 29 years.</p>

                    <h2>When Minimum Payments Make Sense</h2>

                    <p>Paying the minimum can help during temporary financial difficulties. If you're between jobs or have an emergency expense, making the minimum payment keeps your account in good standing.</p>

                    <p>This prevents late fees, protects your credit score, and keeps your account from going to collections. It's a short-term solution to avoid immediate consequences while you get back on track.</p>

                    <h2>Minimum Payment Requirements</h2>

                    <p>Most credit cards require a minimum payment of $25 to $35, even if the percentage calculation would be less. This ensures the card company receives a meaningful payment each month.</p>

                    <p>If you have a very small balance, like $100, your minimum might be the entire balance. Cards typically require you to pay the full amount when balances drop below a certain threshold.</p>

                    <h2>What Happens If You Miss the Minimum</h2>

                    <p>Missing a minimum payment triggers several consequences. First, you'll be charged a late fee, typically $30 to $40. Second, you might lose any promotional interest rates you had.</p>

                    <p>If you're more than 30 days late, the credit card company may report it to credit bureaus, which can hurt your credit score. After 60 days, your interest rate might increase to a penalty rate, which can be 29.99% or higher.</p>

                    <h2>Paying More Than the Minimum</h2>

                    <p>You can always pay more than the minimum payment. In fact, paying as much as you can each month is one of the most effective ways to reduce credit card debt.</p>

                    <p>Any amount above the minimum goes directly toward reducing your principal balance. This lowers the amount that interest is calculated on, helping you pay less interest overall.</p>

                    <h2>Minimum Payment Warnings</h2>

                    <p>Credit card statements now include minimum payment warnings. These show how long it will take to pay off your balance if you only make minimum payments, and how much interest you'll pay.</p>

                    <p>They also show what happens if you make a slightly higher payment. This helps people understand the true cost of paying just the minimum.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Minimum payment is the least you can pay without being late, usually 1-3% of your balance</li>
                        <li>It's shown on your monthly statement and must be paid by the due date</li>
                        <li>Paying only minimums means paying much more in interest and taking years longer to pay off debt</li>
                        <li>A $2,000 balance with $40 minimum takes decades to pay off with just minimums</li>
                        <li>Missing the minimum payment results in late fees and potential credit score damage</li>
                        <li>Paying more than the minimum saves money on interest and pays off debt faster</li>
                        <li>Use minimums only as a temporary measure during financial hardship</li>
                    </ul>
