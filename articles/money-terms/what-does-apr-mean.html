                <div class="content">
                    <p>APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It's the yearly cost of borrowing money, shown as a percentage. When you borrow money through a credit card, loan, or mortgage, the APR tells you how much that borrowing will cost you each year.</p>

                    <p>Think of APR as the price tag for borrowing money. Just like knowing the price of groceries helps you budget, knowing the APR helps you understand what a loan will actually cost you.</p>

                    <h2>How APR Works</h2>

                    <p>When you borrow money, you pay back more than you borrowed. The extra amount is the cost of borrowing. APR shows that cost as a yearly percentage.</p>

                    <p>Here's a simple example. If you borrow $1,000 with a 10% APR, you'll pay about $100 in interest over one year. That means you'd owe around $1,100 total.</p>

                    <h2>What APR Includes</h2>

                    <p>APR typically includes two main costs. First, there's the interest rate, which is the basic cost of borrowing. Second, there are certain fees like loan origination fees or processing charges.</p>

                    <p>This is why APR is often higher than the interest rate alone. A loan might have a 9% interest rate but a 9.5% APR because of additional fees.</p>

                    <h2>Real-World APR Examples</h2>

                    <p>Credit cards commonly have APRs between 15% and 25%. If you carry a $1,000 balance on a card with 20% APR, you'd pay about $200 in interest over a year if you only made minimum payments.</p>

                    <p>Personal loans usually have APRs between 6% and 36%, depending on your credit. A $5,000 loan at 12% APR would cost you about $600 in interest over one year.</p>

                    <p>Mortgages typically have lower APRs, often between 3% and 8%. On a $200,000 mortgage at 6% APR, you'd pay about $12,000 in interest in the first year.</p>

                    <h2>Why APR Matters</h2>

                    <p>APR helps you compare different loans or credit cards fairly. Two credit cards might look similar, but one with 18% APR costs less than one with 24% APR.</p>

                    <p>The difference adds up quickly. On a $2,000 balance, an 18% APR costs about $360 per year in interest, while 24% APR costs about $480. That's $120 more for the same amount borrowed.</p>

                    <h2>Types of APR</h2>

                    <p>Credit cards often have different APRs for different uses. Purchase APR applies to things you buy. Cash advance APR applies when you withdraw cash, and it's usually higher.</p>

                    <p>Some credit cards offer promotional 0% APR for a limited time, like 12 or 18 months. After the promotional period ends, a regular APR applies to any remaining balance.</p>

                    <h2>Fixed vs Variable APR</h2>

                    <p>Fixed APR stays the same unless you're notified of a change. Variable APR can change based on market conditions, usually tied to something called the prime rate.</p>

                    <p>Most credit cards have variable APRs. If the prime rate goes up, your APR goes up too. This means your borrowing costs can change over time.</p>

                    <h2>How to Find APR Information</h2>

                    <p>Credit card companies must tell you the APR before you sign up. It's listed in the card's terms and conditions. You'll also find it on your monthly statement.</p>

                    <p>For loans, lenders provide APR information in the loan agreement. Federal law requires this disclosure so you can make informed decisions.</p>

                    <h2>APR vs Interest Rate</h2>

                    <p>While related, APR and interest rate aren't identical. The interest rate is just the cost of borrowing. APR includes the interest rate plus other fees.</p>

                    <p>For example, a mortgage might have a 5% interest rate but a 5.3% APR after including closing costs and fees. Always look at APR for the complete picture.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
