                <div class="content">
                    <p>A billing cycle is the time period between credit card statements. It's typically about 30 days long, though it can range from 28 to 31 days depending on the month. At the end of each billing cycle, the credit card company creates a statement showing all your transactions and what you owe.</p>

                    <p>Think of it like a chapter in a book. Each billing cycle is one chapter that starts, records all your activity, then ends. A new chapter (cycle) begins immediately after.</p>

                    <h2>How Billing Cycles Work</h2>

                    <p>Every credit card has a specific billing cycle. If your cycle runs from the 1st to the 30th of each month, that's your billing cycle. All purchases, payments, and fees during those dates appear on one statement.</p>

                    <p>On the last day of the cycle (the 30th in this example), the credit card company tallies up everything. They calculate your balance, minimum payment, and due date, then send you a statement.</p>

                    <h2>Billing Cycle Example</h2>

                    <p>Let's say your billing cycle runs from March 5 to April 4. During these 31 days, you make several purchases totaling $850. On April 4, your billing cycle ends.</p>

                    <p>The credit card company creates your statement on April 5. It shows your $850 in charges, any fees or interest, and your total balance. The due date might be April 30, giving you about 25 days to pay.</p>

                    <p>On April 5, your next billing cycle starts. It will run until May 4. Any purchases you make from April 5 onward appear on your next statement, not the current one.</p>

                    <h2>Finding Your Billing Cycle</h2>

                    <p>Your credit card statement shows your billing cycle dates at the top. It might say something like "Billing Cycle: 03/15/2026 - 04/14/2026."</p>

                    <p>You can also find this information in your online account or by calling customer service. Once you know your cycle, it typically stays the same each month.</p>

                    <h2>Closing Date vs Due Date</h2>

                    <p>The closing date is the last day of your billing cycle. This is when the credit card company stops adding transactions to that statement and calculates your balance.</p>

                    <p>The due date is when your payment must be received. This comes 21 to 25 days after the closing date. Federal law requires at least 21 days between these two dates.</p>

                    <p>For example, if your closing date is the 20th, your due date might be the 15th of the following month. You have about 25 days to pay the balance shown on that statement.</p>

                    <h2>Grace Period Explained</h2>

                    <p>The time between your closing date and due date is called the grace period. If you pay your full statement balance during this time, you typically don't pay interest on new purchases.</p>

                    <p>Let's say you charge $500 on March 10. Your billing cycle ends March 25, and your payment is due April 18. If you pay the full $500 by April 18, you won't be charged interest on those purchases.</p>

                    <p>However, if you carry a balance from a previous month, most cards won't give you a grace period. Interest starts accruing on new purchases immediately.</p>

                    <h2>Why Billing Cycles Matter</h2>

                    <p>Understanding billing cycles helps you plan when to make large purchases. Buying something right after your cycle closes gives you the longest time before payment is due.</p>

                    <p>If you buy a $1,000 TV on March 26 and your cycle closed on March 25, that purchase appears on your next statement. You won't have to pay for it until about 50-55 days later, assuming you have a 25-day grace period.</p>

                    <p>Buy that same TV on March 24 (before the cycle closes), and it's due in about 25-30 days instead.</p>

                    <h2>Billing Cycle Length</h2>

                    <p>Most billing cycles are approximately one month long. The exact number of days varies because months have different numbers of days.</p>

                    <p>A cycle that always runs from the 10th to the 9th of the next month might be 28 days in February, 31 days in March, and 30 days in April. The date stays consistent (the 10th), but the length changes slightly.</p>

                    <h2>Multiple Credit Cards</h2>

                    <p>If you have multiple credit cards, each has its own billing cycle. They probably don't align, which means you might get statements on different days of the month.</p>

                    <p>Card A might close on the 5th, Card B on the 15th, and Card C on the 25th. This means you'll get three separate statements each month with different due dates.</p>

                    <h2>Changing Your Billing Cycle</h2>

                    <p>Some credit card companies let you request a different closing date. This can help you align your payment due dates with your paychecks or other bills.</p>

                    <p>For example, if you get paid on the 1st and 15th, you might request a closing date around the 5th so your due date falls around the 30th, right after you get paid.</p>

                    <h2>What Appears on Each Statement</h2>

                    <p>Your statement includes all transactions from that billing cycle. This covers purchases, payments, fees, and interest charges that occurred between the start and end dates.</p>

                    <p>It shows your previous balance, new charges, payments made, fees added, interest charged, and your new balance. It also lists your minimum payment and payment due date.</p>

                    <h2>Billing Cycle and Interest Charges</h2>

                    <p>Credit card companies calculate interest based on your daily balance during the billing cycle. They add up your balance for each day of the cycle and divide by the number of days to get your average daily balance.</p>

                    <p>This average daily balance is then used to calculate how much interest you owe. This is why making a payment in the middle of a billing cycle can reduce your interest charges.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A billing cycle is the period between credit card statements, usually about 30 days</li>
