            <p class="intro">Making a basic budget takes about 30 minutes and requires just a pen, paper, and your recent bank statements. You'll list your income, list your expenses, assign dollar amounts to each category, and make sure the numbers balance.</p>

            <p>This guide walks you through creating your first budget from scratch, even if you've never done it before.</p>

            <h2>What You'll Need</h2>

            <p>Before starting, gather these items:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Recent pay stubs showing your take-home pay</li>
                <li>Bank statements from the last 2-3 months</li>
                <li>Credit card statements (if you use credit cards)</li>
                <li>List of recurring bills</li>
                <li>Paper and pen, or a spreadsheet/budgeting app</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You need this information to create accurate budget numbers based on reality, not guesses.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Calculate Your Monthly Income</h2>

            <p>Start with your actual take-home pay—the amount deposited into your account after taxes and deductions.</p>

            <h3>If You're Paid Monthly</h3>
            <p>This is simple. If you receive $3,400 once per month, that's your monthly income.</p>

            <h3>If You're Paid Biweekly</h3>
            <p>You receive 26 paychecks per year (two per month, plus two extra). To find monthly income, multiply one paycheck by 2.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Biweekly Pay</h4>
                <p>Paycheck amount: $1,450</p>
                <p>Monthly income: $1,450 × 2 = $2,900</p>
                <p>(Note: You'll receive three paychecks twice a year)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>If You're Paid Weekly</h3>
            <p>Multiply your weekly paycheck by 4 to get an approximate monthly amount.</p>

            <p>Weekly paycheck of $700 becomes $2,800 per month for budgeting purposes.</p>

            <h3>If You Have Irregular Income</h3>
            <p>Look at the last 6-12 months of income. Use the lowest month or calculate an average. It's better to budget conservatively than optimistically.</p>

            <h3>Multiple Income Sources</h3>
            <p>Add all sources together. If you earn $2,600 from your main job and $400 from weekend work, your total monthly income is $3,000.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: List Your Fixed Expenses</h2>

            <p>Fixed expenses are costs that stay the same every month. These are usually your largest, most predictable bills.</p>

            <h3>Common Fixed Expenses</h3>
            <p>Write down your actual amounts for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Rent or mortgage payment</li>
                <li>Car payment</li>
                <li>Car insurance</li>
                <li>Health insurance (if paid separately)</li>
                <li>Student loan payments</li>
                <li>Phone bill</li>
                <li>Internet service</li>
                <li>Subscriptions (streaming, gym, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Maria's Fixed Expenses</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent: $1,150</li>
                    <li>Car payment: $295</li>
                    <li>Car insurance: $140</li>
                    <li>Phone: $75</li>
                    <li>Internet: $60</li>
                    <li>Streaming services: $35</li>
                    <li>Gym: $40</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Fixed: $1,795</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 3: Estimate Your Variable Expenses</h2>

            <p>Variable expenses change from month to month. Look at your bank statements to see what you typically spend.</p>

            <h3>Common Variable Expenses</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Groceries</li>
                <li>Gas for your car</li>
                <li>Electric and water bills</li>
                <li>Eating out/restaurants</li>
                <li>Entertainment</li>
                <li>Clothing</li>
                <li>Personal care (haircuts, toiletries)</li>
                <li>Household items</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Estimate</h3>
            <p>Review your last 2-3 months of spending. Find the average or use the highest month to be safe.</p>

            <p>If you spent $380, $420, and $450 on groceries over three months, budget $450 or an average of $417. Starting higher prevents overshooting.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Maria's Variable Expenses</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Groceries: $420</li>
                    <li>Gas: $110</li>
                    <li>Electric: $85</li>
                    <li>Water: $35</li>
                    <li>Eating out: $180</li>
                    <li>Entertainment: $100</li>
                    <li>Personal care: $60</li>
                    <li>Miscellaneous: $80</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total Variable: $1,070</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 4: Include Savings as an "Expense"</h2>

            <p>Treat savings like a bill you must pay. Add a line for savings in your budget.</p>

            <p>Even if it's just $50 or $100 to start, putting savings in your budget ensures it happens. You can increase this amount as you find more room in your budget.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Maria's Savings</h4>
                <p>Emergency fund: $200</p>
                <p>Vacation fund: $100</p>
                <p><strong>Total Savings: $300</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 5: Add Up Everything</h2>

            <p>Now add your fixed expenses, variable expenses, and savings together to get your total monthly spending.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Maria's Total Budget</h4>
                <p>Fixed expenses: $1,795</p>
                <p>Variable expenses: $1,070</p>
                <p>Savings: $300</p>
                <p><strong>Total: $3,165</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 6: Compare to Your Income</h2>

            <p>This is the critical step. Your income must be greater than or equal to your total expenses plus savings.</p>

            <h3>If Income Is Higher</h3>
            <p>Great! You have money left over. Decide what to do with it—add it to savings, pay extra on debt, or add a new budget category.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Surplus Budget</h4>
                <p>Income: $3,400</p>
                <p>Expenses + Savings: $3,165</p>
                <p><strong>Leftover: $235</strong></p>
                <p>Maria can add this to savings or create a new category.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>If Expenses Are Higher</h3>
            <p>You need to make adjustments. Either cut expenses or find ways to increase income.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Deficit Budget</h4>
                <p>Income: $2,900</p>
                <p>Expenses + Savings: $3,165</p>
                <p><strong>Shortfall: -$265</strong></p>
                <p>This doesn't work. Maria needs to cut $265 from expenses.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 7: Adjust Until It Balances</h2>

            <p>If your budget doesn't balance, you need to make changes. Look for areas to cut.</p>

            <h3>Easier Cuts</h3>
            <p>Start with variable expenses and wants:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reduce eating out from $180 to $100</li>
                <li>Cut entertainment from $100 to $50</li>
                <li>Lower grocery budget by buying store brands</li>
                <li>Cancel unused subscriptions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Harder Cuts</h3>
            <p>If you need bigger changes, consider:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Getting a roommate to split rent</li>
                <li>Switching to a cheaper phone plan</li>
                <li>Shopping for lower car insurance rates</li>
                <li>Temporarily reducing or pausing savings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The goal is to balance without making life miserable. Find sustainable cuts you can maintain long-term.</p>

            <h2>Step 8: Write It Down</h2>

            <p>Put your final budget in writing. This can be on paper, in a spreadsheet, or in a budgeting app.</p>

            <h3>Simple Budget Template</h3>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Monthly Budget - [Month/Year]</h4>
                
                <p><strong>INCOME</strong></p>
                <p>Take-home pay: $______</p>
                <p>Other income: $______</p>
                <p>Total Income: $______</p>
                
                <p><strong>FIXED EXPENSES</strong></p>
                <p>Rent/Mortgage: $______</p>
                <p>Car payment: $______</p>
                <p>Insurance: $______</p>
                <p>Phone: $______</p>
                <p>Internet: $______</p>
                <p>Other: $______</p>
                
                <p><strong>VARIABLE EXPENSES</strong></p>
                <p>Groceries: $______</p>
                <p>Gas: $______</p>
                <p>Utilities: $______</p>
                <p>Eating out: $______</p>
                <p>Entertainment: $______</p>
                <p>Personal care: $______</p>
                <p>Other: $______</p>
                
                <p><strong>SAVINGS</strong></p>
                <p>Emergency fund: $______</p>
                <p>Other goals: $______</p>
                
                <p><strong>TOTAL EXPENSES + SAVINGS: $______</strong></p>
                <p><strong>INCOME - TOTAL: $______</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 9: Track Your Spending</h2>

            <p>Creating the budget is just the start. Now you need to track actual spending against your plan.</p>

            <p>Each time you spend money, note which category it falls under. At least weekly, check how much you've spent in each category versus your budget.</p>

            <p>If you're at $280 of your $420 grocery budget with two weeks left, you're on track. If you're at $380 with two weeks left, you need to slow down.</p>

            <h2>Step 10: Review and Adjust Monthly</h2>

            <p>At the end of each month, compare what you actually spent to what you budgeted. Use this information to improve next month's budget.</p>

            <p>Maybe you consistently overspend on groceries by $50. Increase that budget category and decrease another to compensate.</p>

            <p>Budgets evolve over time. Your first budget won't be perfect, and that's okay. Each month teaches you more about your spending patterns.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Budget Success</h2>

            <h3>Start Simple</h3>
            <p>Don't create 30 detailed categories. Start with 8-10 broad categories and refine later if needed.</p>

            <h3>Be Realistic</h3>
            <p>Budget for reality, not fantasy. If you spend $400 on groceries, don't budget $250 hoping to magically change overnight.</p>

            <h3>Include Fun Money</h3>
            <p>Budget some money for entertainment or personal spending. A budget that's all sacrifice won't last.</p>

            <h3>Plan for Irregular Expenses</h3>
            <p>Annual expenses like car registration or holiday gifts should be divided by 12 and included monthly so you're ready when they come.</p>

            <h3>Use Round Numbers</h3>
            <p>Budget in round numbers when possible. $400 for groceries is easier to track than $387.43.</p>

            <h2>Common Beginner Mistakes</h2>

            <p>Avoid these pitfalls as you create your first budget:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Using gross income instead of net income</li>
                <li>Forgetting irregular expenses like oil changes or gifts</li>
                <li>Being too restrictive with no flexibility</li>
                <li>Creating the budget but not tracking spending</li>
                <li>Giving up after one imperfect month</li>
                <li>Making it too complicated with too many categories</li>
            </ul>
