                <p>This example shows a complete monthly <a href="how-to-make-a-basic-budget.html">budget</a> for someone earning $4,000 per month after taxes. Your actual numbers will be different based on your income, location, and lifestyle, but the structure and percentages work the same way.</p>

                <p>Seeing real numbers in action makes budgeting less abstract and helps you understand where your own money should go. Let's break down every dollar.</p>

                <h2>Sample Monthly Budget: $4,000 Income</h2>
                <p>This budget represents a single person living in a medium cost-of-living area. They rent an apartment, drive a reliable used car, and balance enjoying life today with saving for the future.</p>

                <h3>Monthly Income</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Take-home pay (after taxes): $4,000</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is net income - what actually hits the bank account. If their gross salary is $5,200, after taxes ($900), health insurance ($200), and 401k contribution ($100), they have $4,000 to budget.</p>

                <h2>Expense Breakdown by Category</h2>

                <h3>Housing & Utilities ($1,300 - 32.5%)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rent: $1,100</li>
                    <li>Electricity: $80</li>
                    <li>Water/Sewer: $40</li>
                    <li>Internet: $60</li>
                    <li>Renter's insurance: $20</li>
                    <li><strong>Category total: $1,300</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why these amounts:</strong> Rent is for a one-bedroom apartment in a mid-sized city. Utilities vary by season - this averages higher summer (AC) and winter (heat) months. Internet is standard speed for remote work and streaming.</p>

                <p><strong>Percentage check:</strong> Housing should be 25-35% of income. At 32.5%, this is reasonable but pushing the upper limit. If rent were $1,400, they'd need to cut costs elsewhere or earn more.</p>

                <h3>Transportation ($700 - 17.5%)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Car payment: $350</li>
                    <li>Car insurance: $150</li>
                    <li>Gas: $150</li>
                    <li>Maintenance fund: $50</li>
                    <li><strong>Category total: $700</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why these amounts:</strong> Car payment is for a $18,000 used car on a 5-year loan. Insurance cost assumes good driving record and moderate coverage. Gas budget assumes 15-mile daily commute. Maintenance fund builds up for oil changes ($50 every 3 months) and eventual repairs.</p>

                <p><strong>Percentage check:</strong> Transportation typically runs 10-20% of budget. At 17.5%, this is on the higher end but normal for car owners. Using public transit would cut this to $150-200 monthly.</p>

                <h3>Food ($600 - 15%)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Groceries: $450</li>
                    <li>Dining out & takeout: $150</li>
                    <li><strong>Category total: $600</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why these amounts:</strong> Groceries cover all meals cooked at home for one person - about $15/day. Dining out budget allows 2-3 restaurant meals weekly plus occasional coffee or lunch out. This balances home cooking with convenience and social eating.</p>

                <p><strong>Percentage check:</strong> Food typically ranges 10-15% of budget. This example is right at 15%, which is reasonable. Couples or families would spend more in absolute dollars but similar percentages.</p>

                    <div class="ad-placeholder ad-rectangle">Advertisement - Rectangle (300x250)</div>
                </div>

                <h3>Personal & Healthcare ($400 - 10%)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Health insurance: $200</li>
                    <li>Phone bill: $60</li>
                    <li>Gym membership: $40</li>
                    <li>Personal care (haircuts, toiletries): $50</li>
                    <li>Clothing: $50</li>
                    <li><strong>Category total: $400</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why these amounts:</strong> Health insurance is the monthly premium for marketplace coverage (employer coverage comes from gross pay). Phone is unlimited data plan. Gym membership includes basic amenities. Personal care averages monthly haircuts, skincare, and basics. Clothing budget builds over time for needed replacements.</p>

                <h3>Entertainment & Miscellaneous ($300 - 7.5%)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Streaming services (Netflix, Spotify, etc.): $40</li>
                    <li>Entertainment & hobbies: $160</li>
                    <li>Gifts (birthdays, holidays): $100</li>
                    <li><strong>Category total: $300</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why these amounts:</strong> Streaming covers 3-4 services. Entertainment includes movies, concerts, hobbies, books, and fun activities - about $40/week. Gifts budget averages annual spending ($1,200/year) so money is ready when occasions arise.</p>

                <p><strong>Important note:</strong> This "wants" category is essential for budget sustainability. Without money for fun, you'll rebel against the budget and overspend impulsively.</p>

                <h3>Debt Payments & Savings ($700 - 17.5%)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Student loan minimum payment: $200</li>
                    <li>Emergency fund contribution: $300</li>
                    <li>Retirement savings (Roth IRA): $200</li>
                    <li><strong>Category total: $700</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why these amounts:</strong> Student loan is federal loan on standard 10-year plan. <a href="../saving/what-is-emergency-fund.html">Emergency fund</a> gets priority until reaching 3-6 months of expenses saved (goal: $10,000). Retirement contribution builds for the future even while paying debt.</p>

                <p><strong>Percentage check:</strong> Saving 12.5% ($500) while paying debt ($200) totals 17.5%. Financial experts recommend 15-20% for savings and debt combined. This budget achieves that goal.</p>

                <h2>What Makes This Budget Work</h2>

                <h3>Every Dollar Has a Purpose</h3>
                <p>This is a <a href="zero-based-budgeting.html">zero-based budget</a> - income minus all expenses equals exactly zero. Every dollar is assigned to a category before the month begins. There's no vague "leftover" money that disappears.</p>

                <h3>Follows General Guidelines</h3>
                <p>The budget roughly follows recommended percentages: 30% housing, 15% transportation, 15% food, 15% savings. These aren't rigid rules, but this budget shows they're achievable for many people.</p>

                <h3>Includes Both Needs and Wants</h3>
                <p>Essential expenses (rent, insurance, groceries) coexist with quality-of-life spending (dining out, entertainment, gym). A budget that's all needs and no wants fails quickly.</p>

                <h3>Prioritizes Future While Living Today</h3>
                <p>$500 goes to savings and retirement ($300 + $200) while still enjoying life now. This balances present enjoyment with future security - the key to sustainable budgeting.</p>

                <h2>How to Adapt This Budget to Your Situation</h2>

                <h3>If Your Income Is Different</h3>
                <p>Use the percentages, not the dollar amounts. Earning $3,000 monthly? Your rent might be $900 (30%), transportation $450 (15%), and so on. Earning $6,000? Scale everything up proportionally.</p>

                <p><strong>Example $3,000 budget:</strong> Housing $975, Transportation $525, Food $450, Personal $300, Entertainment $225, Savings $525 = $3,000 total.</p>

                <h3>If You Live in an Expensive City</h3>
                <p>Rent might take 40-50% of income in places like New York or San Francisco. You'd need to reduce other categories (smaller entertainment budget, less dining out, cheaper car) or increase income to maintain balance.</p>

                <h3>If You Have a Family</h3>
                <p>Add <a href="budget-categories-explained.html">categories</a> for childcare, children's activities, larger grocery budget, and bigger housing. Total dollar amounts increase significantly, but percentage framework still applies.</p>

                <h3>If You're Debt-Free</h3>
                <p>Without that $200 student loan payment, redirect that money to savings ($500 emergency fund + $200 retirement + $200 extra savings = $900 total, or 22.5% saved). Aggressive savings accelerates financial goals.</p>

                <h3>If You Have More Debt</h3>
                <p>Prioritize debt payoff by reducing wants categories. Cut entertainment to $150, reduce dining out to $75, eliminate some subscriptions. Redirect those savings to extra debt payments.</p>

                <h2>Common Budget Scenarios</h2>

                <h3>Scenario 1: $5,000 Monthly Income</h3>
                <p>With an extra $1,000/month, don't inflate lifestyle expenses proportionally. Instead:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increase savings to $800 (vs $500)</li>
                    <li>Add $200 to debt payments</li>
                    <li>Allow reasonable lifestyle upgrades ($300 - maybe nicer apartment or newer car)</li>
                    <li>Keep $200 for true financial flexibility</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scenario 2: Irregular Income</h3>
                <p>Freelancers or commission-based workers should budget using their lowest monthly income from the past year. When earnings exceed that base, extra goes to savings or variable expenses. Never count on the high months.</p>

                <h3>Scenario 3: Shared Finances (Couple)</h3>
                <p>Combine both incomes, list all shared expenses. Maybe you earn $4,000 and partner earns $3,500 = $7,500 combined. Budget together from that total. Housing might be $1,800, transportation $900 (two cars), food $900, etc.</p>

                <h2>Creating Your Own Budget</h2>
                <p>Use this example as a starting template, not a rigid prescription. Here's how to make it yours:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Start with your actual take-home income</li>
                    <li>List your fixed expenses (rent, car payment, insurance)</li>
                    <li>Estimate variable expenses (groceries, gas, entertainment)</li>
                    <li>Allocate remainder to savings and debt payoff</li>
                    <li>Make sure income minus expenses equals zero</li>
                    <li>Track spending for a month to see if estimates were accurate</li>
                    <li>Adjust next month's budget based on reality</li>
                </ol>

                <p>You can also use a <a href="../../calculators/budget.html">budget calculator</a> to plug in your numbers and automatically see your percentages and totals.</p>

                <h2>Tips Based on This Example</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Track percentages, not just dollars:</strong> Knowing housing is 32.5% helps you evaluate if that's sustainable</li>
                    <li><strong>Build in flexibility:</strong> Entertainment category isn't sacred - if car repairs hit, temporarily reduce dining and fun</li>
                    <li><strong>Review monthly:</strong> These exact amounts will change. Review and adjust every month</li>
                    <li><strong>Celebrate wins:</strong> Staying within this budget for 3 months straight is a huge achievement</li>
                    <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Your first budget won't be perfect. This example took months to refine</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3 style="margin-top:0">Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom:0">
                        <li>A realistic $4,000 budget: 32.5% housing, 17.5% transportation, 15% food, 10% personal, 7.5% entertainment, 17.5% savings/debt</li>
                        <li>Zero-based budgeting means income minus expenses equals exactly $0 - every dollar has a purpose</li>
                        <li>Use percentages as guidelines, not rigid rules - adjust to your location and situation</li>
                        <li>Include both needs and wants - budgets with only essentials fail from restriction</li>
                        <li>Prioritize emergency fund ($300/month) and retirement ($200/month) even while paying debt</li>
                        <li>Adapt this template to your income by scaling percentages up or down</li>
                        <li>Track for a month, then adjust amounts based on actual spending patterns</li>
