        <h1>About PennyExplained</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to PennyExplained - where personal finance is made simple, clear, and accessible for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        
        <p>We believe everyone deserves to understand their money without wading through confusing jargon or feeling intimidated by complex financial concepts. Our mission is to break down personal finance basics into clear, straightforward explanations that anyone can understand.</p>

        <p>Whether you're creating your first budget, building an emergency fund, or trying to understand what a credit score actually means, we're here to help you feel confident about your financial decisions.</p>

        <!-- NEW SECTION -->
        <h2>Who's Behind PennyExplained</h2>

        <p>I built PennyExplained because I know what it's like to feel completely lost about money.</p>

        <p>My background is in software development, not finance. A few years ago, I realized I didn't understand basic financial concepts that everyone seemed to take for granted. What's the difference between gross and net income? How does compound interest actually work? Why does everyone say I need an emergency fund?</p>

        <p>I started researching these topics, expecting clear answers. Instead, I found:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Articles full of jargon that assumed I already knew the basics</li>
            <li>Content that was secretly trying to sell me something</li>
            <li>Advice that felt more like lectures than education</li>
            <li>Explanations that made simple concepts sound complicated</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As a developer, I approach complex systems by breaking them down into components, understanding how each part works, and building up from there. I realized personal finance could be explained the same way - systematically, clearly, without the jargon.</p>

        <p>PennyExplained is the resource I wish existed when I was starting out. It's built for people who are curious about money but feel intimidated by traditional finance content.</p>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> I'm not a financial advisor, accountant, or finance professional. I'm someone who learned these concepts through careful research and wanted to share that knowledge in a way that actually makes sense. For personalized financial advice, always consult a certified professional.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        
        <p>PennyExplained provides:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear Educational Content:</strong> We explain financial concepts in plain language, without the jargon. No complicated formulas, no confusing terminology - just straightforward information.</li>
            <li><strong>Free Financial Calculators:</strong> Practical tools to help you plan your budget, calculate your emergency fund, and track your savings goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Beginner-Friendly Articles:</strong> Step-by-step guides on budgeting, saving, banking, credit, and other personal finance fundamentals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        
        <p>We focus on explaining <em>how things work</em> rather than telling you what to do. Personal finance is personal - what works for one person might not work for another. Our goal is to give you the information you need to make your own informed decisions.</p>

        <p>Everything on PennyExplained is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Educational Only:</strong> We explain concepts and systems, we don't provide specific financial advice</li>
            <li><strong>Jargon-Free:</strong> When we use financial terms, we define them in plain language</li>
            <li><strong>Example-Driven:</strong> We use real numbers and realistic scenarios to illustrate concepts</li>
            <li><strong>Judgment-Free:</strong> Everyone's financial situation is different, and we respect that</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Create Content</h2>

        <p>Every article on PennyExplained follows a research and verification process:</p>

        <h3>1. Research from Authoritative Sources</h3>
        <p>We start with information from government agencies and established financial education resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Federal Reserve (economic data and consumer finance statistics)</li>
            <li>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</li>
            <li>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</li>
            <li>Bureau of Labor Statistics (inflation data, consumer spending)</li>
            <li>IRS and Treasury Department (tax and financial regulations)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Cross-Reference and Verify</h3>
        <p>We verify facts across multiple sources to ensure accuracy. If statistics or data are included, we cite where they came from.</p>

        <h3>3. Write for Real Beginners</h3>
        <p>We write at an accessible reading level (8th grade) and avoid jargon. When financial terms must be used, we define them immediately in plain language.</p>

        <h3>4. Use Real Examples</h3>
        <p>Every concept includes practical examples with real dollar amounts, not vague descriptions like "some money" or "a significant amount."</p>

        <h3>5. Stay Educational, Not Advisory</h3>
        <p>We explain <em>how things work</em> and <em>what options exist</em>, not what you should do. Your financial decisions are yours to make.</p>

        <h3>6. Update Regularly</h3>
        <p>We monitor our content and update it when financial information changes (like interest rates, regulations, or program requirements).</p>

        <h2>Who We're For</h2>
        
        <p>PennyExplained is designed for:</p>

            <li>People who want to understand the basics before making financial decisions</li>
            <li>Anyone looking for clear, straightforward financial education</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We're Not</h2>
        
        <p>We want to be clear about what we don't do:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We don't provide personalized financial advice</li>
            <li>We don't recommend specific financial products or services</li>
            <li>We don't cover investment strategies or stock picks</li>
            <li>We're not financial advisors, tax professionals, or lawyers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For personalized advice, always consult with a qualified financial professional who understands your specific situation.</p>

        <p><strong>About AI and Technology:</strong> As a tech professional, I use modern tools (including AI writing assistants) to help research and draft content. However, all information is verified against authoritative sources, reviewed for accuracy, and edited before publishing. The responsibility for all content quality and accuracy is mine.</p>

        <h3>Educational, Never Advisory</h3>
        <p>We explain concepts, systems, and how things work. We never tell you what to do with your money, recommend specific products, or make "best" claims. Personal finance is personal - what works for one person may not work for another.</p>

        <p>If something requires professional expertise (like tax strategy or investment advice), we say so and recommend consulting a qualified professional.</p>

        <h3>No Hidden Agendas</h3>
        <p>We don't:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Receive compensation for recommending products or services</li>
            <li>Write "reviews" that are actually advertisements</li>
            <li>Use affiliate links disguised as recommendations</li>
            <li>Promise financial outcomes or returns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Accuracy Matters</h3>
        <p>We take accuracy seriously. If we make a mistake, we correct it. If information becomes outdated, we update it. If you spot an error, please <a href="contact.html">let us know</a>.</p>
